            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

For the christian faith is not such whose end cannot be found, so that we should haue néed alwaies to séek. And this my opinion is confirmed by the doctrin of the Euangelists and Apostles. For in the end of Saint Iohn his Gospel we read that Christe did many things whiche were not written in the same Book of Saint Iohn, for if they should or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly be written, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> world could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <note place="margin">Iohn. 20. and 21.</note> them.

Wherfore as faith only receueth Christ, so he with all his merits appertain onely vnto the faithful, and so he is the healt<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:210353:35"/> of Christe and his merits, whiche Christe onely is our righteousnesse and euerlasting saluation. And héervnto al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so accordeth saying. <hi>To him</hi> (to wit vnto Christe) <hi>do all the prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles bear witnesse that all those vvhich beleeue in him shall receiue remission of sinnes through his name.</hi> Also Saint <hi>Peeter</hi> ioyneth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> testimonies of bothe the testaments bothe of the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and plainly affirmeth that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue bothe remission of sinnes and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life by faith. And who dare require any more? Is it noteuidently and plainly showed by these woords by what meanes man is fréed and iustified from sin before God? But where I pray you in all this tretise of iustificatiō are foūd those woord{is} or phrases, whiche these suttle disputers vse to mingle in the intreating therof, as to call it y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> substantiall &amp; incleuing iustice and such like termes, wherfore this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion or matter which of it self is euident &amp; plain inough, is by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> menes of these bra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>blers obscured &amp; called into questiō: wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore layīg aside those straūge &amp; vnknowē spéeches: let vs study to folow the sacred and plain spéeches of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> prophet{is} &amp; apostles which are more cléer &amp; apt to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> purpose.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:210353:36"/>
                  <p> Now that we are not iustified and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by woorks: is alredy by the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes <note place="margin">Of good woorks.</note> afore said, sufficiently prooued. And therein also may wee sée wherfore good woorks doo serue, to wit, that God hath or dained them to the end that suche as are iustified, might be occupyed in them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the law of God, and as he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained it from the beginning. Therfore whosoeuer is iustified, is iustified by grace before he hath doon any good work{is} and that without any deseruing by the onely faith in Christe, that is to say, by Christe him self. For they are not good woorks till he be iustified, and then they help not to finish that matter, because it was finished before, by the merits o<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> Christe. But he whiche is iustified tho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>row grace in Christe, the same is iust and dooth iustly, that is to say, hee dooth good woorks euen as a good frée bringeth foorth good frute. And these kindes of woorks are witnesses of true faith and iustification. But where these signes are not: true faith nor true iustification is not.</p>
                  <p>And to this end are those sayings of
<pb facs="tcp:210353:36"/> the blessed Apostles as of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> writing that <hi>Abraham</hi> was iustified by <note place="margin">The doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and Peeter tou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching good woorks.</note> woorks and not by faith onely, and that faith is manifestly declared by good woorks. <hi>Iames.</hi> 2. Again, Saint <hi>Peeter</hi> which biddeth to showe vertue with faith and knowledge with vertue, addeth, <hi>For he that hath not these things is blinde and gropeth with bis hands.</hi> 2. <hi>Peter.</hi> 1. But the minde of the blessed Apostles is not to make frustrate and voide both the incarnation, death and merits of Christe by these sayings, for if we be iustified and saued by the Law and our woorks, Christe is dead in vain as <hi>Paule</hi> testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Wherfore their minde is to teache <note place="margin">Sal. 2. 5.</note> vs, that good woorks make euident vnto vs that faith and iustification is all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy come before: and therfore in that they say we are iustified by woorks: their mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning is that those good woorks declare or testifie.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore when <hi>Paule</hi> sawe and red these kindes of writings, he was not <note place="margin">The apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles did not contēd about good woorks.</note> by and by angry breking foorth with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations against <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Peeter,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they peruerted the Gospell of
<pb facs="tcp:210353:37"/> Christe attributing to tittle to faith, and to much to woorks: for look what Péeter or Iames hath writē as touching woork{is}. <hi>Paule</hi> him self in his Epistles hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the same. Furthermore in the coūtel held at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the Apostles méeting there togither concluded vpon the doctrin of iustification, that we were iustified on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by grace through faith in Christe, and that we were not purged, saued or made righteous by the law or woorks, yea and <hi>Peter, Iames, Iohn, Paule</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> gaue hands eche to other in token of soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie, <note place="margin">Sal. 2.</note> &amp; also wrot letters as touching the same thing, as blessed <hi>Luke</hi> hath diligent<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly written it. <hi>Act.</hi> 15. and is of vs expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in an other place. And that whiche was there concluded: all the Apostles and holy fathers haue obserued with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, without any controuersie euen vnto their blessed deathes.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore when some of the ministers of this our age doo plain and manifestly <note place="margin">The contro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nercy agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> confesse that we are iustified and purged from sinne and that onely by grace tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row faith in Christe, and not by any good
<pb facs="tcp:210353:37"/> woorks or merits of our owne, yet they teach that good woorks must necessarily fo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>low faith, and are to be doon of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and that we may not bost of faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but rather showe the same by good woorks. Others therfore doo vniustly and without cause so furiously cry out against them, saying that these men deny God and ouerthrowe the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>But they should rather keep that mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all peace, which the afore named Apostle{is} did vse amongst them selues. For indéed to tel the trueth, there ar many lewd and light fellowes, which prate of faith &amp; yet are faithlesse, and beléeue not with the hart, and of such speaketh <hi>Paule,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooueth them that say they knowe God and yet deny him with their deeds, <hi>bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abhominable, vnruly, and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate to euery good vvork. Tit.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>Also there are raysed more wicked <note place="margin">A contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on touchīg the diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and hu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>manitie of Christe.</note> and hurtful contentions and discords in the Churche touching the deuine and humain nature of our Saueour Iesus Christe, of which the Scripture dooth also so plainly and euidently instruct vs
<pb facs="tcp:210353:38"/> that he whiche wil hear and beléeue the same woord, may quickly flée those bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and intricate disputations, and stop his eares from those manifest and ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hominable blasphemyes. For the holy Prophets &amp; Apostels doo testifie so plain and euidently touching the true diuinitie of our Sauiour Iesus Christe that he is very God, and the eternall and onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten sonne of God, that nothing can be more plain or euidently expressed.</p>
                  <p>And God in <hi>Esai</hi> the Prophet saith. <hi>I</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Esay. 45.</note>

But if he were not God he could not be a Sauiour and so our faith should be in vaine. Therfore all those who deny the diuinitie of Christe: go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to subuert our faith and bring man into eternall death and damnation. For wee cannot be deliuered from the same,
<pb facs="tcp:210353:38"/> but onely by our Sauiour Iesus Christe.</p>
                  <p>Also the Lord in the 35. chapter of <hi>Esay</hi> sayeth, <hi>Speak vnto those that are fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Be ye strong, fear not, beholde your God commeth vvith vengeance, euen God vvith recompence, hee wil come and he vvil saue you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this is spoken of Christe who is very God, and came into the worlde to make satisfaction and to saue, may ease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plainly be gathered by the woords which immediatly folowe. <hi>Then shall the blinde see, and the deaf hear, then shall the lame man leap and the tung of the dum shall sing. &amp;c.</hi> And he which wil confer these things which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Euangelists, touching our Saue our Ies{us} Christ with these, shall finde all these to be fulfilled in the comming of Christ the sauiour. Wherfore Christe is God whom <hi>Esay</hi> did so euidently before set foorth vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>Also <hi>Esay</hi> in the 7. chapter writeth that the <hi>Messiah,</hi> Christe and Lord should be borne of a virgin and be called <hi>Emanuel</hi> which signifieth God with vs. Again in the 9. chapter he sayeth a Childe shalbe
<pb facs="tcp:210353:39"/> borne for vs, &amp; a sonne is giuen vnto vs, the power is vpon his shoulders, and his name shalbe called wunderful, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seler, the mightie God, the euerlasting fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and prince of peace, and the increace of his gouernment, &amp; peace shalbe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end, vpon the throne of <hi>Dauid</hi> and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his kingdome. &amp;c.

Of which Christe him self speaketh. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. <hi>Micheah</hi> in his 5 chap. doth fortel that Christe the prince and captain of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, should be borne at Bethléem. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his going foorth or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: is from euerlasting. For the same cause <hi>Ieremy</hi> nameth him y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> séed, sute, or rod of <hi>Dauid</hi> and also calleth him y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Lord and liuing God, and our righteousnesse, when as notwithstanding we know that God is our righteousnesse, wherfore of ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cessitie we must conclude that Christe is very God.</p>

And thus we sée how soone euen while the Apostles yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: the Deuil began to sprincle his dead ly poyson in the Church. Against these therfore S.

<pb facs="tcp:210353:40"/> we did sée his glory as the glory of the only begotten Sonne of the father, ful of grace and trueth.</p>
                  <p>Also the same Euangelist writeth of <hi>Iohn</hi> the fore runner of Christe thus. <note place="margin">The testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Iohn bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist touchīg Christes ci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>minitie.</note>

                  <p>Likewise the Apostles worshiped Christ ascending into Heauen. <hi>Luke.</hi> 24. And <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. chap.

                  <p> And afterward in the 14. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> Christ saith to his disciples. <hi>Let not your harts</hi>

                  <p>Also in the same chapter he sayth. <hi>Now therfore O father glorifie thou me with the same glory vvhich I had vvith thee before the world was made.</hi> And <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> falling prostrate before Christe cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>My Lord &amp; my God.</hi> Finally <hi>Ioh.</hi> so finisheth his Gospel, that he layeth this to be the conclusion and the ground of the whole history of the gospel which he had written, that is, that we might beleeue that Iesus Christe is the Sonne of God, and so beléeuing we may haue euerlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life.</p>

                  <p>And he is one onely and euerlasting God, who hath reueled him self in his woord (which we beléeue, and wherwith we content our selues) and therin he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth himself, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost, which are indéed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stincted the one from the other, and yet are they but one God: for the same scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wherby the maiestie of God is made manifest vnto vs, dooth plainly teach that the Sonne is not seperated or deuided from the Father, but that hee is of the same nature with him; as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> hath taught vs, as before I haue recited saying. <hi>In the beginning vvas the vvoord and the vvoord vvas with God, and that vvoord vvas GOD.</hi>

                  <p>Also in the 10. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> Christe sayeth. <hi>I and the Father am one thing.</hi>

All that my father hath is mine, for I haue said he shall receiue it of me, vvhich he shall shovv vnto you.</hi> Wherfore it is euident that the Father, the Sonne and the holy Ghost, be one God in one onely vndeuided substance of Godhed. For as in one Sun thrée distinct things are eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dētly <note place="margin">A similitud</note> seen, that is to say. The body of the Sun from the which light or brightnesse dooth procéed, and from them bothe heat: and yet notwitstanding there are not iij. Sunnes but one whole &amp; vndeuided sun, neither yet dooth this vnitie let wherby these three things should not be distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, so that eche haue his owne propertie, for the body of the Sun is not the light,
<pb facs="tcp:210353:45"/> neither is the heat of the body nor the light: euen so the vnitie of the diuine sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance dooth not make that the Father hath béen incarnate or dead for vs, or that the Sonne is the Father, or the holy Ghost the Sonne or the Father.</p>
                  <p>For the Scripture dooth manifestly distinct them, and attributeth to eche of them his propertie. The Father sendeth the Sonne into this worlde. The Sonne is sent into this worlde and is made man in the Virgins wombe, dyeth on the Crosse, commendeth his soule to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he dooth and speaketh those things whiche in the History of the Euangelists are mentioned of him. The holy Ghost procedeth from the father and the sonne, as we haue all redy showed by the woord{is} of Christe, and he hath those propertyes which are attributed to him in the woord of God.</p>
                  <p>But there was in times past certain curious searchers (of which there are no <note place="margin">The proper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties of the persons in one Godhed must not be confounded.</note> small number in this our age) which did confound the properties of the father, the sonne and the holy Ghost, which also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued a iust rewarde, euen the sting and
<pb facs="tcp:210353:45"/> torment of conscience, so that at the last they knew not what they should thinck. These would not be contented with the simple and plain spéech (as often it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth) for wheras the olde fathers after the Apostles time vsed certain termes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréeing to the holy Scripture for the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of this matter as <hi>Trinitie, Vnity, Person,</hi> and the distinction and propertie of persons, they altogither refused these (as many doo in this our age) which wold knowe more then God had reueled vnto thē by his woord, for God hath made him self manifest vnto vs as we haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before &amp; héer more plainly wil showe, to wit. First that there is one God in sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stance as these woords doo manifestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare when he sayeth. <hi>Heare O Isarel the Lord thy God is one God,</hi> which words Christe bringeth in <hi>Mark</hi> the xij.</p>
                  <p>Secondly this one God hath reueled him self to be distincted into thrée persons, to wit, the Father, the Sonne and the holy Ghost, whiche <hi>Dauid</hi> confirmeth <hi>Psal.</hi> 33. saying. <hi>By the vvoord of God were the heauens made, &amp; by the breth of his mouth the host of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:210353:46"/>
                  <p> Also the Lord him self euidently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth to baptise in the name of the father, of the sonne, and of the holy ghost. And as we are baptized, so we ought to beleeue, like as the articles of the christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith, or our Créed dooth teach vs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue. And to ascend to a further reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and knowledge, it is but the curious and foolishnesse of man, and also dissobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ingratitude, and therfore a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked thing.</p>
                  <p>Consider what chaunced to <hi>Moyses</hi> and what answere he had of God when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to see him euen as he is in glory: the answere was made vnto him. <hi>Thou shalt not see my face, for no man shall see me and liue.</hi> But when we shalbe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from this corruption, then shall we see God euen as he is, as Iohn testifi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth. In this present life certain signes and shewes are giuen to <hi>Moses,</hi> with the whiche bothe he and eche man els must content him self. And these are at large set foorth <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. and 34. That which remaineth to be séen, we must wait for it vntil we come to y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> place where we shall beholde him perfectly, and in the meane
<pb facs="tcp:210353:46"/> time let vs beholde him: with the eyes of faith, as we are sufficiently taught by his holy woord. Remember the woords of the wise man sayung, <hi>Search not for things past thy capacitie and things to mightie for the, thou shalt not search, but vvhat God hath commaunded thee think on them. It is not necessary for thee to see those things vvhich are had frō thine eyes Ecclesiasticus.</hi> 3. And this serueth for the peace of conscience and publique quiet in the Church of Christe which otherwise by the curious and rash searching of vnquiet spirits is troubled and at the last quite ouerthrown.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer holy Scriptures speake of <note place="margin">Of Christes humanitie.</note> the incarnation of Christe, with no lesse simplisitie and plainnesse: for they mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly teache that he took very mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the body of the blessed virgin Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and in all things was like vnto vs, sin onely excepted, and that he was borne true God &amp; true man. And therfore he is called in bothe the Testaments the frute of the wombe of <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi> Of this <hi>Paule</hi> euidently testifieth. <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.

                     <hi>The vvord vvas made flesh:</hi> not that the diuinitie was turned and chaunged into the humain nature, but the Sonne of God took (for <hi>Paule</hi> vseth the same woord) true humain flesh, that is to say, mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and soule, and ioyned, this humain na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to him self into one person, or in the vnitie of person, as the olde Fathers call it, that these twoo things, true God and true man might be one Christe our medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator and redeemer, so that eche nature might be in one euen in Christe, &amp; kéepe his propertie wholly and vnconfused.</p>
                  <p>And therfore <hi>Paule</hi> saith, that he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the Gospell of the Sonne of God whiche was borne of the séede of <hi>Dauid</hi> according to the flesh, and was declared to be the Sonne of God in power &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>Peeter</hi> sayeth <hi>That Christe su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffred for vs in the flesh.</hi> And Christe him self sayeth that he was called of <hi>Dauid</hi> bothe his Sonne and his Lord.

                  <p>And truely by the glorification and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention

                  <p>For if the Lord Christe should haue put from him the veritie of his humain body and not retained a naturall body: then that indissoluble band of the vnitie of the person should be broken; and then there should be preached but onely half a Christe as he which were onely God and not man.</p>

                  <p>Wherfore those troublesome dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of certain whiche begin to write and teach in this our age that all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the diuine maiestie of Christe is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffused &amp; poured into the humain nature so that as the diuinitie, so the humanitie is present euery where and therby they take away the propertie of the humaine nature in Christe, renuing that filthy opi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Eutichians</hi> which long agone was condemned,</p>
                  <p>This pernitious doctrin of them that maintain the body of Christe to be in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery <note place="margin">The plain and euident iudgment of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the heauens of the blessed.</note> place hath also brought into the Church another monstrous opinion ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heer to fore heard of amongst y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, to wit, that the heauen is euery where, and that there is no certain place appointed for the godly. Wherfore if the heauens be also euery where, so as they are not onely abooue but also in the earth beneath, yea euery where, then must it
<pb facs="tcp:210353:48"/> come to passe by this vbiquitie that the ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry deuils be ni the Heauens also &amp;c. But the doctrin of Christe and of the Apostles, as also the Catholick &amp; true faith, whiche euer yet hath béen allowed and confessed in the Churche dooth plainly ouerthrowe that opinion. For yet hetherunto it hath béen truly beléeued by the woord of God that the Heauen is a place ordained of God for the blessed, for abooue the sight of those heauens whiche wee now beholds and distincted from them, and far distant from the Earth and therefore muche far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> writeth 16.) distant from hel, where the deuil and damned doo liue, who haue no parte in the Heauenly habitation of the blessed. Christe, who best of all knew what and where heauen was, calleth it the place and house of his Father. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14. Furthermore in the hi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>story of Christes ascentiō it is by euident reasons showed that he ascended farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>booue the Clouds and sight of the Skyes and was receiued into the Heauen the place of all the blessed like as it manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appéereth in the Gospel, in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles &amp; diuers other places of the
<pb facs="tcp:210353:49"/> Apostles writing{is} as also expressed in the articles of our Creed. And frō this heauen in true humain nature shall the Lord cōe again (for they shall sée him whome they haue wounded) and shall descend in the cloudes to iudge both the quick &amp; the dead, and this iudgemēt béeing finished: he shal take the faithful bothe in body and soule with him into y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> heuē on high the place of the blessed as <hi>Paule</hi> euidētly teacheth by the woords of the Lord. 1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. and <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. Wherfore let bothe the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and his auditory be contented with this cléer certain simple and comfortable doctrin and rest in it and shake of those vain trifles of the vbiquitie of heauē: yea let this cōtrouersie be an example to tech vs y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> these vnhappy brawles which bréed so great offēce in y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> church of christe, may easely be remoued if we can content our selues with the trueth and simplicitie of the holy Scriptures. For therby we shall so fully &amp; perfectly be taught that we shall haue no néed of any straunge proude and contentious disputations.</p>
                  <p>Likewise there hath béen sharp dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations <note place="margin">Controner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy about the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per.</note> abooue these 47. yéeres touching
<pb facs="tcp:210353:49"/> Sacraments, and chéefely about the holy Supper of our Lord Iesus Christe. For one parte teacheth that the Supper of the Lord is not a bare signe, significatiō and commemoration of Christe, by the which not onely his body and blood is signified and kept in memory, but that Christ him self is present at his Supper, and that his true body and true blood is giuen and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued togither with the bread and wine, not onely of the beléeuers, but also of the vnbeléeuers and vnworthy.</p>
                  <p>The other parte teacheth that the Sup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per of the Lord is a signe indéed, or a sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification and commemoration of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood or passion of Iesus Christe: and yet it is not a naked or bare signe, but a Sacrament or sacred pledge of the diuine grace and gifts of Christe, neither is it an vneffectuall, sained or vnfrutefull commemoration, but by the Spirit and true faith it is an effectuall and holsome commemoration of the Passion of Christe, and the Lord him selfe is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at the Supper to the faithfull, for otherwise were it not the Supper of the Lord.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:210353:50"/>
                  <p> And there is not onely bread and wine re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiued in this supper as they doo eat and drink in common Suppers, but the true body and blood of Christe is receiued to life eternall and that of the faithful onely and not of the vnfaithful and vnworthy, which receiue the Bread and the Cup of the Lord to their iudgement. Also that the faithful doo giue thanks to God, and that they are mutually knit togither in one body vnder one hed euen Christ, and that by this action they professe their faith as hetherto it hath been the maner in the church of Christe, either to teach or write concerning this matter. Wherfore if this plain order had béene obserued, there had béen no discord in the Churche about the supper of the Lord. But because cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain new termes and Philosophicall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions or rather Sophisticall, began to be mixed by little and little vnder the Pope with his simplici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ie, yea and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some at this day not beeing conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the olde simple plainnesse, and stoutly retaining the foresaid new deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, are raised odious and vehement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions contray to the true nature of the
<pb facs="tcp:210353:50"/> Sacraments whome. God did ordain to nurish peace and looue, and not to kindle discord, contention and hatred. For if they of whome I first spake must open to vs the maner of the presence of Christe <note place="margin">The maner of Christes presēce and how he is aten.</note> in his Supper and of the Partaking of his flesh and blood: they answere that Christe is bothe present and receiued in the Supper substancially, corporally and with the very mouth, that is to say, his body is eaten with the mouth euen of the vnfaithful, and that because the Lord said <hi>Take ye, eat ye, this is my body, this is my blood.</hi> For say they, these woords are substanciall and effectuall, and therfore they ought to be vnderstand simply and according to the very letter and woords them selues. But the other say that by this meanes there is added to the plaine woord of God, a straunge and papisticall glose, contrary to the nature of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, founded and ordayned by the Popes law. <hi>Distinct. secunda, de conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cra. Ego Berengarius. &amp;c.</hi> For the Lord (say they) in his last Supper, as it is kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to all men, instituted a certain acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or maner of dooing, which might be an
<pb facs="tcp:210353:51"/> admonition, exercise, and commemorati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on (for thus he plainly sayeth. <hi>Doo this in remembrance of me)</hi> and an holy signe or Sacrament of that thing, which the Lord once finished on the Crosse, so that it neither may nor can be doon again: to wit, that he gaue his body to death for vs, and shed his blood for the washing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of our sinnes, and so once sacrificed him self vnto God. Wherfore touching this his commemoration &amp; holy sacramēt he hath spoken Sacramentally: for this is a sacramentall kinde of speaking and euermore vsed in the Churche, as appée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by many examples of bothe the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staments where the names of the things signified, are attributed and giuen to the signes.</p>
                  <p>For Circumcision is expresly called the couenaunt of God, and y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Paschal lamb is called the Passouer, yea, the sacrifices are called sin, sanctification and clensing of sinnes, and Baptisme is called the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of regeneratiō and clensing. &amp;c. And yet was there neuer any man in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Churche that contenciously defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:210353:51"/> or said that any of these were substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially the thing it self which they were na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med for. In like maner the Lord in his supper called the Bread &amp; wine his body and blood, béeing in very déed but y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> signes and Sacraments of his true body and blood.</p>
                  <p>And the Scriptures doo thus speake of Sacraments, to the end that we might not cleue only to the outward signes: but chéefely to the things signified, and that we may knowe that those whiche receiue the Sacraments by true faith according to the institutions of God, are also made partakers of the things signified: and by this meanes we receiue it holsomly and frutefully vnto eternall life, that is when we receiue the same spiritually by faith, and not carnally, corporaily and with the chawing of mouth.</p>
                  <p>After this sorte therfore is our Lord Iesus Christe present in his Supper, and so is his fleshe and blood eaten in very déed vnto eternall life.</p>
                  <p>But because that the vnfaithfull haue not eternall life it followeth that
<pb facs="tcp:210353:52"/> they receiue not the body and blood of Christe, whiche béeing receiued giueth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting life, they therfore receiue the Sacrament onely of the body and blood of Christe to their condemnation as Saint <hi>Paule</hi> writeth and that because of their vnbeléef wherby they ar made vnworthy</p>
                  <p>The Lord him self in the 6. of <hi>Iohn</hi> expoundeth this matter, where he first teacheth that his flesh &amp; his blood (and not any other thing els) is the only very true <note place="margin">The Lord him self ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth this contro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uersy.</note> meat and drinck vnto euerlasting life.</p>
                  <p>And therfore who soeuer will haue eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, must eat and drinck his body, and blood. Furthermore he euidently show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how his very body and blood is eaten and drunck. For he sayeth. <hi>I am that bread of life, he that commeth vnto me shall neuer hunger, &amp; he that beleeueth in me shall neuer more thirst.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to eat and drinck is nothing els as Christe expoundeth it, but to beléeue. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain when the <hi>Capernaits</hi> vnderstood his woords of eating and drincking his flesh and blood corporally and carnally, that is, that they should eat his flesh and drinck his blood with their mouth and téeth, he
<pb facs="tcp:210353:52"/> willing to remooue this error from their mindes, expoundeth his owne meaning in these woord{is}. <hi>The flesh</hi> (to wit fleshly eaten as they took it) <hi>profiteth nothing, it is the Spirit that quickneth, for the vvoords vvhiche I speake vnto you are spirit and life.</hi> Wherfore it foloweth that his very flesh and very blood must be eaten and drunck spiritually by faith.</p>
                  <p>But in his last supper the Lord spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of none other flesh and blood then that whiche hee spake of before in the 6. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> because indéed he hath none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther humain body but one, the which both before his Supper and afterwarde at his Supper was euermore all one.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer Saint <hi>Augustine lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de consensu Euangelistarum. cap▪</hi> 1. dooth plainly affirme that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelist did not make mention of the bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy and blood of the Lord in the last Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per as the other euangelists haue doon, for that the Lord him self in an other place, (to wit in the 6 of <hi>Iohn)</hi> hath at large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the same. Wherfore, although the Lord in his last supper did ad an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde signe for a remembrance, vnto
<pb facs="tcp:210353:53"/> his body and blood, yet can it not be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued any other way vnto saluation thē by that which he hath al redy declared in the 6. of <hi>Ioh.</hi> This also is tobe considered that <note place="margin">Sacramēts are the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of faith</note> sacraments are signes or as <hi>Paule</hi> sayeth seales of the righteousnesse of faith which are added to regeneration and iustificatiō béeing the principall parte, and sum of the gospel touching faith in Christ, &amp; therfore they are somwhat inferiour to the gospel, for so <hi>Paule</hi> saith y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> he was sent not to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise but to preach the gospel. And therfore euen all they which be vnder y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> Pope him self confesse with one consent that the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is of more valure thē the sacrament{is}, for what resonable man at any time hath contended saying, that regeneration and iustification cannot be effectually &amp; true, except it be substātiall, that is to say, that those which be regenerated by the Spirit and iustified by faith in Christe, are not regenerate &amp; iustified, except they haue in them the whole body and flesh of Christe substancially and corporally? Why then should wee attribute more to the signes (which are indéed inferior to the doctrine of faith) then to the Gospell and doctrine
<pb facs="tcp:210353:53"/> of faith it self? for man is regenerat by the spirit of God &amp; iustified by faith in Christ (as <hi>Nicodemus, Cornelius</hi> and the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch</hi> of Quéene <hi>Candace</hi> are examples) although in this regeneration and iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation he hath not in him self the Lord cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>porally and carnally. And cannot he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the signe profitably by faith and the spirit except he eat &amp; drink the body and blood corporally and with the bodyly mouth?</p>
                  <p>And as touching the true body and blood of the Lord (of the which bread &amp; wine in <note place="margin">where the very body of Christis</note> the holy supper of the Lord are sacramēts and pledges) not onley the scriptures but also the articles of our faith teache vs, that our Lord Iesus Christe hath a true humain body, with the which he did sit at the table with his disciples, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he said. <hi>Take ye, eate ye, this is my body</hi> And sith they did not eate that same body corporally: it must of necessitie followe that these woords.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take ye, eate ye, this is my body,</hi> are not to be vnderstand according to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryletter, but that they haue a spirituall and not a corporall meaning,</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:210353:54"/>
                  <p> For with the same body he arose from the table and went foorth with his Disciples into the Mount <hi>Oliuet,</hi> and the next day was crucified dead and buryed with the very same body he ascended into heauen, and is now therfore no more with the same héer in Earth, but is in Heauen, as he plainly taught by the Sermon whiche he made at his last supper, which woords so manifest and so often repeated, ought to be of no lesse authority and waight then these, <hi>This is my body.</hi> Wherfore that which the Papists ad, saying, substanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and corporally, is a certain glose ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly repugning the woords and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Lord and true faith, and therfore woords nothing appertayning to this purpose.</p>
                  <p>But such as are of the contrary minde answere this place, saying, that whē they say corporally and substancially, they vse <note place="margin">Christes bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy is no body.</note> not this woord substantiall after a grose maner, as to signifie a sensible carnall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and therfore for the declaration héerof some of them ad héerunto this saying, that it is substantiall indéed, but yet not according to the maner of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> qualitie, quan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>titie
<pb facs="tcp:210353:54"/> or circumscription of place. But this exposition is not taken from the pure and liuely fountain of the woord of God, but from the troubled puddles of Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie, and is a glose partely taken from <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquine,</hi> in the 3. parte of the 76. question. But letting these passe, we answere, if the body of Christe be not in the Supper according to quantitie (as them selues say) neither yet circumscript or contayned in a place as in a place, sith all bodies are circumscript and contained in some place, it must necessaryly followe that Christes body is not corporally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the Supper, whiche thing also we our selues doo beléeue and teache. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is of necessitie that this spirituall and Sacramentall woork, be also spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and sacramentally vnderstand and not corporally. &amp;c. Wherfore then dispute we or contend any longer about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Are not these things plain inough?</p>
                  <p>Again, therfore it euidenly appéereth and may easely be perceiued that if we obserue and kéep the simplisitie and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of the holy Scriptures, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently follow the same, vsing the phrases
<pb facs="tcp:210353:55"/> and spéeches of the Scriptures, that then these things may easely be vnderstand, and so concord be established and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: but if straunge woords and formes of speaking be mixed with the Scriptures (which by y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> menes ar so interpreted, that they can very hardly be vnderstād of the simple and ignorant) thē contrary oppini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at brought in, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> matter it self is obscu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red, contentions &amp; discorde are raysed and spred abrode. But I haue hetherto recited certain examples that by thē they might learn and as it were w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> their eyes beholde euen that which at the first was our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to doo, to wit, that if the ministers of the Church▪ would be contented with the godly simplicitie which is set foorth in the woord of God and would not mingle ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with straunge and new found things: it might come to passe that these pernitious contentions and discords might be quite taken away, and so the people who are committed to their charge: might of them be frutefully instructed. Otherwise what frute or what sound doctrin can the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple man receiue to the edification of him self by these contentecious sermons whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che <note place="margin">Vnfruteful. Sermons.</note> onely intreate of matters in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersy
<pb facs="tcp:210353:55"/> and in dout, and ouerflow with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil spéeches, brawlings, nips, and taunts, and therfore build not vp faith and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, destroy not wickednesse and sin, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort not to good woorks nor comfort the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fflicted: but rather offend and disquiet the mindes of the simple, gréeue their harts and kindle discorde and variance.</p>
                  <p>These are not the frutes of the Spirit, <note place="margin">Salla. 5.</note> but the woork{is} of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> flesh against the which the wrath of God dooth iustly burn: and therfore these contentio{us} ministers of the church doo greatly sin against the maiestie of God; and prouoke his vengeāce against them selues. But now let vs speake of <note place="margin">Ftutefull Sermons.</note> good and profitable Sermons, and see what Christ him self hath taught, &amp; what he hath cōmaūded his ministers to teach and how also the blessed Apostles his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants haue obserued this his cōmaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Let vs now sée what the Apostles preched through y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> whole world, how they conuerted men to God &amp; what they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maūded vs to preach in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> name of Christ. And although these things are at large de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clared in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> word of God, yet I wil as bréef<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly as I may intreat of them and so touch euery thing summaryly.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:210353:56"/>
                  <p> Saint <hi>Mark</hi> the Euangelist hath set foorth vnto vs a bréef, but yet an excellent <note place="margin">what and how Christ preached.</note> and manifest some of all the Sermons of Christe, in these woords saying. <hi>Iesus came into Galile preaching the Gospel of the kingdome of God, saying the time is fulfilled, and the kingdome of God is at hand, amend your liues and beleeue the Gospel, Mar.</hi> 3. Wherfore the summe of Christes Sermons was to preach the gospel of the kingdom of God. And of the gospel these are y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> cheef points.</p>
                  <p>First that God hath prepared his king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome for vs, and that he offereth the same fréely vnto vs, and tbat he is ready to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte the same to vs, and to receiue vs in to it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly to th'end that we may come to that kingdome and obtain the same that we must acknowledge our corrupt nature and sin and so repent.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly that before all things we must beléeue the gospel by the which is showed vnto vs, that God our moste merciful fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his frée grace hath giuen vnto vs his onely begotten Sonne that he might be our Sauiour, and that he was made
<pb facs="tcp:210353:56"/> man, and crucified for our sinnes and rose again from the dead for our iustification, and that he is the only and alone true me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diator by whome we are reconciled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God and obtain forgiuenesse of sinnes and eternall life. For so Christe in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sermons hath expounded these chéef points as it may easely appéere in the writings of the Euangelists and special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the gospel of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as Christe him self did continue <note place="margin">what Christ hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to be precheed</note> by the space of thrée yéeres preaching this doctrin of the Gospel, and mixed not any other straunge doctrin with it, so he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded his disciples to preach the same Gospel, and therfore in Saint <hi>Mark</hi> he chargeth them saying. <hi>Go ye into the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersall vvorld, and preach the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to euery creature. VVhoso belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and is baptised shalbe saued, but whoso beleeueth not shalbe condēned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And again in the Gospel of Saint <hi>Luke</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke. 24.</note> he sayeth. <hi>Thus it is vvritten, and so Christe ought to suffer, and rise againe the third day from the dead, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes and newnesse of life to be preached amongst all nations in</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:210353:57"/>
                     <hi>his name.</hi> Wherfore by these woords we may throughly perceiue, that first the preaching of repētance for the reforming of our sinful life, and then secondly the doctrin of faith in Christe in whome we haue remission of sinnes, and all things els necessary to eternall saluation, are the twoo chéef and principall points of sound christian doctrin. The which twoo the blessed Apostles did onely apply them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues vnto, that the world might through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, faithfully and plainly be instructed therin.</p>
                  <p>For when <hi>Peeter</hi> was asked of the <note place="margin">what the Apostles preached</note> Iewes (whose harts were pricked with sorow for their sinnes) what they should doo, he answered: repent and be baptised euery one of you, in the name of Iesus Christe vnto the remission of sinnes.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Paule,</hi> when he had called togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Act. 20</note> at <hi>Miletum</hi> the Ministers of the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> sayeth to them.</p>

                     <hi>I haue kept back nothing that vvas profitable for you, but haue showed and taught you openly, through euery house, testifying bothe to the Ievves and Grecians, the repentance tovvardes God, and faith through our Lord Iesus.</hi>

                  <p>The same he also professed before king <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Festus</hi> the President of the Romains saying.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iesus said vnto me, I send thee vnto the Gentiles, that thou mayest open their eyes, that they may be conuerted from darcknesse to light, and from the povver of Sathan, vnto GOD, that they may receiue remission of Sinnes and haue felovvshippe amongst the Saints, through faith in me</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Héere vnto also appertayneth that whiche is written by the Apostle. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2

                     <hi>I when I came vnto you brethern came not vnto you vvith gloriousnesse of vvords or wisdome preaching vnto you the testimony of God.

                  </p>
                  <p>Again in his Epistle to <hi>Titus</hi> chap. 2. he comprehendeth the whole some of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian doctrin in these woords. <hi>The hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some grace of God hath shined vnto all mē, teaching vs. &amp;c.</hi> To this short and perfet sum of doctrin he in th'end addeth. <hi>These things speak, exhort &amp; reproue vvith all authoritie. Se that no man des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise thee.</hi> As though he said, there is none other thing that thou shouldest be careful of, for these whiche I haue rehearsed are the true and chéef points of true and soūd doctrin, which if any man doo handle and
<pb facs="tcp:210353:58"/> vse a right he néed not fear to be depised.</p>
                  <p>And this Apostle when he had set down <note place="margin">we must cast frō vs all conten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations.</note> in his Epistle to <hi>Timothe</hi> these chéef points of sound doctrin, immediatly hee sharply condemneth vnprofitable and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious disputations and contentions, and sayeth. <hi>If any man teach otherwise and consenteth not vnto the holsome words of our Lord Iesus Christe, and to the do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctrin vvhiche agreeth to godlinesse: he is puffed vp and knoweth nothing, but douteth about questions and strife of vvords, wherof commeth hatred, strife, bravvling, euil surmising, vain disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men of corrupt minde, by the which the trueth is cleene taken avvay vvhiche thinck that gain is godlinesse. Seperate thy self from such.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>So great labour, woork and diligence <note place="margin">what is the matter of holsome doctrin.</note> dooth the sincere doctrin of repētance and faith in Christe require, if we wil out of bothe the Testaments haue fit doctrin to admonish, comfort, and reprooue to edifica<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, that the minister in no wise shall need to take care for any other doctrine or yet to bend his minde or study to brawles and vnprofitable disputations. For if he
<pb facs="tcp:210353:59"/> wil doo that which the Lord him self hath commaunded, and the Apostles haue com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maunded vs to teach, then shall he right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly instructe his hearers what and which is true repentance, of what they ought to repent or amend, what sin is, and what iniustice or vnrighteousnesse is, and what the law of God teacheth touching these things, and what punishment remaineth for the impenitent and transgressors of the law of God. Of all these haue we manifest examples in the sermons of the Prophets, in the history of the Gospell, Acts of the Apostles, and in their Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</p>
                  <p>If therfore we will preach in like maner to the people now a dayes and show them how they agrée or dissagrée with this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin: we sould haue inough to doo. And as the Lord did fore tell vs that our times should be like the times of <hi>Noah</hi> &amp; <hi>Loth,</hi> so in very déed the corrupt and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble maners of this our present age dooth minister ouermuch matter sharply to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue wickednesse and wicked men and to exhort euery one to repentance and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:210353:59"/>
                  <p> And therfore the ministers of the church haue inough to doo so that they néed not to hale at the half of contentions and thrust into y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Church vnnessary and vnfruteful questions, yea suche as are stuffed with all heat of choler. Therfore he whiche hath wherin to doo better: let him auoid the wurse.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore if we wil rightly teach the true faith in Christe, (as euery man <note place="margin">the doctrīe of faith in Christe.</note> ought chéefely to doo) we shall finde i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough wherof to intreate. To wit, to showe from whence faith commeth, who giueth it, what faith is, and chéefely, to whom Faith leaneth, which is vnto God and to the onely begotten Sonne of God, our Lord Iesus Christe, and to his holy and moste sure promises, where also may be showed what these promises are.</p>
                  <p>And by these meanes héere are offered many godly and swéet places to intreate vpon, as of GOD, the grace of God, his goodnesse and iustice, of our Lord Iesus bothe GOD and man, what he taught, what he did, and suffered for vs, how by him we are redeemed, what the Father
<pb facs="tcp:210353:60"/> hath giuen vs in him, and that in him is the fulnesse of all things, and that there is none other name vnder heauen giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to men by whiche they shalbe saued, and that he is the true <hi>Messiah,</hi> and only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator king and high Préest, our sacrifice, satisfaction, righteousnesse, and sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he is our only hope, consolation, help and faithful defence in whome wee haue all things whiche are necessary to our saluation: also by what meanes wée may obtain remission of our sinnes, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row faith in him, and be iustified, and that not by our owne merits or any other meanes.</p>
                  <p>Also this place offereth to speake of the sundry frutes of faith, that is to say, of good <note place="margin">Good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God.</note> woork{is} and euery good vertue and of other profitable ordinances of God, whiche are ioyned togither with these, as of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and of the office and duty of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gistrate and the subiect and such like. I haue recited these places (although a great many mo might yet bee rehearsed) to th'end that all men may sée, and as it were handle with their hād{is}, how many much more necessary and frutefull places
<pb facs="tcp:210353:60"/> are set foorth to be touched and intreated of by the ministers of the Church, rather then their vnprofitable quarelings whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che they bring and thrust into the Pulpet before the congregation to the bréeding of great offence. But of the aforesaid true kinde of teaching, <hi>Paule</hi> writeth thus. <hi>Abide in these things, vvhiche if thou</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.</note>
                     <hi>shalt doo: thou shalt bothe saue thy self and those vvhich shall hear thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the lest let the minister wel beholde that one book, which is not great, euen the Book of the Acts of the Apostles, written by blessed <hi>Luke,</hi> which in 28. chapters (in <note place="margin">The booke of the acts of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.</note> to the which the whole Booke is diuided) containeth all which the Apostles taught and profitably ordained in the church for the space of 28. yéeres after the ascention of Christ: but in the whole book there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be found somuch as one contentions si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, much lesse any such brawling dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations as they exercise now dayly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting in the meane time the aforesaid chéef and fruteful points of doctrin. <hi>Peter,</hi> but chéefely <hi>Paule</hi> in all the Churches, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogs and in all places els preached re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and faith in Iesus Christe the
<pb facs="tcp:210353:61"/> true <hi>Messiah</hi> and sauiour, and also graue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did confute with great modestie the Iewes, who spake against them. They exhorted to prayer, they minstred the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments according to the institution of Christe, and did all things to edification and true faith, so did the Apostles and so ought we to doo by their example.</p>
                  <p>There are many excellent and holy book{is} <note place="margin">The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mōs of the Apostles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</note> in bothe the Testaments writen by the Prophets and Apostles, these let the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters haue in their hands, and out of them let them preach repentance &amp; faith in Christe. For there is more waight and authoritie in Sermons, when the very woord of GOD is alleaged and the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Sermons are taken thence, then when men bable their owne oppi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and fantasies.</p>
                  <p>For the minister of god is ordained in the Church, to teach &amp; therfore let him teach the woord of God: and those whiche come into the church, they come not to hear the oppinion and affection of the Preacher, but to hear the woord of God.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore the true woord of God must be purely and faithfully preached to the
<pb facs="tcp:210353:61"/> amendment and comfort of the hearres: and this is acceptable vnto GOD, and bringeth plentiful frute, euen the increse of faith, charitie and all good woorks. But if the only woord of God be not preached but by the contentions affections and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of men, there can follow none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing but that Faith and charitie, must decrease, and breaches and discords, contempt of the woord, a sliding back from the good course begun, yea a manifest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolting as bothe the thing it selfe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience dooth teache and prooue to our great gréef.</p>
                  <p>The Apostles and their Disciples in a <note place="margin">By concord the church is builded ▪ by discord it is spoiled</note> very short space conuerted the whole worlde vnto the Christian Religion and planted many famous Churches where as neuer any were heard of before, and they taught the same plain and simple do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin wherof we spake before. But when those who succéeded thē forget the olde simplicitie &amp; began to giue them selues to suttle &amp; crabbed questions &amp; disputations cōtrary to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> doctrin of the Apostles, &amp; spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially whē they began to teach otherwise thē y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> Apostles did touching y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> diuinity and
<pb facs="tcp:210353:62"/> humanitie of Christe, of the vnitie of his person and the two distinct natures, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che things the <hi>Valetinians, Mancionists Samosatenists, Arrians, Nestorians, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichians, Monothelites,</hi> and other of the same brood did. By and by the church was greuously troubled and weakned, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to decrese and was deuided into sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry sects, til at the last from these discords after 600. yéeres began to arise that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and very sonne of all abhomination euen <hi>Machomet.</hi> And from him the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens and Turks.</note> and <hi>Turkes</hi> tooke their detestable and blasphemous <hi>Alcaron:</hi> and these moste fierce enemyes of christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: doo now possesse all the east parte, and now within these few yéeres hath afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and made war vpon almoste y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> whole west parte. And truly by this example God would teach vs how much he disly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and is offended if the Churche kéep not the simplicitie and vnitie of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and true doctrin which in his woord he hath set foorth vnto vs: and dooth also showe that discords distroy and vtterly spoil those things whiche were set vp and builded by concord.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:210353:62"/>
                  <p> Wherfore I moste hartely beséech all the ministers of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> church of Iesus Christe <note place="margin">An exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to ministers of the church</note> that they end and cast away all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies, and that they knit them selues togither with true concorde and charitie, forgiuing eche other their errors and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, auoid new deuises, straūge woords and phrases, teach the plain sound doctrin which euermore agréeth w<seg rend="sup">c</seg> it self, bring the church in one vnitie vnto Christ, and faithfully indeuer them selues to preserue true concord therin, but chéefely most har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely to pray vnto God for his grace and holy spirit, that they may doo al these thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with a willing and a ready minde.</p>
                  <p>For vnlesse this be doone: an infinit number of soules through y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> fault of these obstinate and discentious Ministers shall moste miserably be brought into the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their damnation. But how will they excuse this fault at the houre of death and in that great day of the Lord? Let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery minister way wel these things with him self, it is an horrible thing to fal into the burning wrath of the Lord. And also that danger followeth whiche <hi>Paule</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of to the <hi>Gallathians</hi> saying.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:210353:63"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If you bite and deuoure one an other, take heed that you be not cōsumed one</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note>
                     <hi>of an other.</hi> Yea there followeth many gréeuous offences of the godly and simple men: but the Lord in the gospel pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth them accursed whiche offend others, <hi>It were better for him</hi> (saith he) <hi>vvhiche</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 18.</note>
                     <hi>shall offend one of these little ones that a milstone were hanged about his neck, and that he vvere drowned in the depth of the Sea.</hi> Good, honest and graue men, and such as haue the gift of faith are angry (and that not without great cause) with these contentious kinde of men, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doo they regarde them or yet estéeme them: but on the contrary parte, wicked and vngodly men are delighted in them, partely for that their wicked life héerby is not as it ought to be, reprooued and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned (for they are so vp to the eares in their contentions, that they cannot intend to exercise their fūction towardes them) partely that they may y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> better maintain their false doctrin, as also to bring the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of those ministers into contempt, who (setting these contentions aparte) doo otherwise teach very godly, that so by
<pb facs="tcp:210353:63"/> these their contentious brawles their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin might be suspected.</p>
                  <p>For they are in good hope that it will come to passe (as often times it dooth) that through suche discention: the Churches cannot long indure, and so in short space true doctrin perisheth and decayeth. But how much the more strife is among the Gospellers, so much the more the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaryes confirme them selues in their errors and that to their owne confusion.</p>
                  <p>But those whiche are come to a little taste of the Gospell, and haue now forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their errors &amp; superstitions and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to cleue vnto the Gospel, they are set back and hindered by these contentions, and say they know there ar many errors, abuses &amp; great fault{is} in the popish church, but yet they cānot ioine thē selues to these who so sharply contēd, accuse &amp; braule one w<seg rend="sup">c</seg> an other. For who (say they) shal showe vs which of thē is in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> right or false opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; to whether part we ought to ioīe our selues? And sith y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> case so stādeth amōg thē, we wil stay vntil they be agréed. But the excuse in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> day of iudgemēt wil not make them faultlesse and at the end of their life
<pb facs="tcp:210353:64"/> except they conuert them selues to Christ and yéeld them selues wholly vnto him, they can neuer haue a quiet conscience. Other some also say that God is the God of peace and concord and not of strife: but these preachers of the Gospell are at dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention amongst them selues &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is not with them. But this might haue béen obiected against the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue and moste holy Church of Christe in the whiche also were some controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, and yet neuerthelesse God was with them,</p>
                  <p>Neuerthelesse by these obiections: it may appéere how greate heapes of euil suspicions these discords and cotentions bring, that therby all the faithful may with the more diligence study peace and concord, for so much as the Lord him self hath said. <hi>Blessed ar the peace makers for they shalbe called the children of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it is greatly to be feared that if striues and contentions procéed and go <note place="margin">God puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of contention.</note> forward in the Church, lest God haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and ordained that same against vs whiche in times past he did in the rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnes of <hi>Dioclesian</hi> and <hi>Maximian</hi> the

                  <p>The effect of that History is diligently to be marked, to wit, that in those dayes the Church of Christe florished. But the faithfull people were vnthankfull vnto God and impenitent, and the ministers of the Church were ambitious and stirred vp gréeuous and hot contentions amongst them selues, wherfore God béeing angry with them, he gaue them vnto tirants who raysed vp greater persecutions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Churche then euer was heard of before.

                     <pb facs="tcp:210353:67"/> example of those moste holy kings, and did the like in his Empire. For when the Bishops in his time were at hatred and contention amongst them selues, &amp; writ and preached one against an other, and letted not to offer those their contentions Libels vnto the Emperour him self to the end they might contend before him. He receiuing all their books, sharply reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them, who for asmuch as they were by the prouidence of God appointed vnto the people for pastors and captains of con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cord and charitie, were so at variance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them selues. Neither would he giue any iudgemēt as touching their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, or yet read their Libels whiche they deliuered vnto him, but cast them into the fire that at the least they might therby learn those contentions &amp; brawles displeased his maiestie, and so setting dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde aparte, might afterward giue them selues to peace and concord.</p>
                  <p>And likewise when he sat with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops at the councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> amongst whome also many contentions were, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foorth the books of the Prophets and Apostles, to wit, the holy Bible, cōmaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:210353:67"/> them to decide and end their contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies by them, and all of them with one consent to preach the same faith.</p>
                  <p>This excellent example of the worthy Emperour <hi>Constantine,</hi> whome God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so made that in this world he was called, the great, whose name and glory through the whole worlde was famous &amp; of great renown amongst all wise men, and is much more excellent and greater in the eternall felicitie, this example (I say) let all Princes and Magistrates of this our age follow, touching the ministers of the Church, that by this meanes they may in in like sorte prouide for the peace and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like health of the Church.</p>
                  <p>There must also a speciall regarde be had lest that the art of Printing, which is <note place="margin">Of the art of printing</note> a moste excellent &amp; profitable gift of God giuen vnto vs in these last dayes, be not abused to prolong and nurish these conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and discords. For this art is giuen of God in this latter age of the worlde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore th'end therof, to the end that the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel and glad tiding{is} of repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes in the name of Christe, might the sooner be spread through the
<pb facs="tcp:210353:68"/> whole world before his cōming to iudgd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (which no dout wilbe euen shortly) that so béeing warned of his comming we might prepare our selues, watch and pray. Furthermore this art of Printing is reueled by God vnto men, that those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent books which by the ancient fathers haue béen written against diuerse errors in defence of y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> trueth in all tungs might be published &amp; made knowen to all men: yea that those things which serue the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of a common welth, the knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of historyes, and other good arts and Sciences might perfectly be learned and knowen.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore it is not to be suffered that so noble and profitable an art, giuen in the worlde for the profit of men, should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused to the contrary, to wit, against God, against right and equitie: so that it should be lawful for euery one by this art to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish his owne affections and indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, slaūders, euil spéeches, and brawles, to accuse innocents, to stir vp strife, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creace and publish the same, to spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode and defend false doctrin and errors.</p>
                  <p>But on the contrary parte such things
<pb facs="tcp:210353:68"/> which are godly, good and profitable for the Church and the common weale, and furthe things as serue to the furtherance therof, as that serue to the exposition and found knowledge of the Scriptures, and aduauncing of true Religion and defence of the trueth against falshod and leasings: such things as serue to the expounding of good lawes and honest arts. Finally such things as tend to the furtherance of peace and concord, for the preseruation of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale and honestie, and the defence and declaration of any mans innocency. These things (I say) ought not to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden or hindred frō publishing by this art, according to the commaundement of S. <hi>Paule</hi> saying. <hi>Quench not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>

                  <p>For although there be neuer so good lawes in Cities, neuer so pure order in Churches, yet if masters of families, doe not practise at home catechising, and discipline in their houses, and ioyne their helping hands to Magistrates, and Ministers: they may in truth, (but vniustly, as many haue done) complaine that their children and seruants are disordered, and corruptted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, when in truth, they were disordered, and are still corrupted, and mard at home. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot be, neither is it to be hoped for, that either the father of his children, or the husband of his wife, or the master of his seruants, should looke for that obedience, that reuerence, that faithfulnesse, and that dutifulnesse, which they of right ought to haue, and the other in conscience, and of bounden dutie are bound to performe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they doe now at length endeuour to see these orders and duties hereafter mentioned, to be practised within their seuerall Households. For if Parents and Householders shall performe no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dutie to their children and seruants, then to prouide for them meat, drinke, and apparrell, and to pay them their wages: then Papists, Atheists, yea, Turkes, and Infidels, doe yeeld this dutie as well as they.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:210353:77"/>
                  <p> And seeing all men be carefull that their Horses and Bullocks should haue sufficient fodder and prouender, to the end they may haue their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in leiu and recompence thereof: it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently follow, that therefore a Christian House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder ought to haue ouer his Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, as much more Christian care, then hee hath ouer his dumbe and insensible beasts, that so hee may make a singular comfort from the daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of their encrease in spirituall graces.</p>
                  <p>Oh what a sweete and comfortable thing shall this be to the soule and conscience of such an house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, when he hath beene so diligent and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the training and bringing vp of his children and Seruants in the obedience and wayes of the Lord, that he may rightly deserue to haue this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie report and commendation giuen vnto him, from the mouth and penne of the godly: namely, that he hath a Church in his house: that is, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of sound and faithfull Christians, such as feare God indeed; as the like report was giuen by the Apostle, to those godly House-keepers, <hi>Aquila,</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> his wife: <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 5. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 19. as also to <hi>Philemon. Phil.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>Therefore all Parents and House-holders are (in the Lord) to be exhorted that they would be carefull to bring vp their children and familie, so as they eyther (by some good tokens) may see them the children of God, and heyres of the couenant, or at the least, they may be comforted in their owne
<pb facs="tcp:210353:77"/> consciences, notwithstanding that their children and seruants (for some cause vnknowne to them (do refuse their counsell and instruction; seeing they to the vttermost of their power &amp; abilitie, haue vsed all good meanes to bring them vp well, and haue rightly offered them to the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Now if parents and masters haue iust cause to bewaile and lament, when (thus trauelling in good education and information) they cannot yet see good effects, and godly fruits in their children and seruants: how much more cause of griefe may they haue, when they haue vsed and bestowed no labour at all (either by themselues or others for them) to bring them vp in the nurture and feare of the Lord?

Therefore let all gouernours be perswaded, that it is their bounden duetie thus to looke to their families, &amp; to be sure that they sanctifie the Lords day, as wel as themselues: &amp; that they not only thus bring them to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ministerie, but also looke vnto them, that they spend the rest of the day in holy exercises, so much as may be: examining them in that which they haue heard, and causing them to confer about it themselues, and to appoint some to read the scripture vnto them, and all of them to sing Psalmes: and generally, whatsoeuer they haue seene before, that they ought to do them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, to call vpon their seruants for the same, and to take such order, that they be sure they doe it: and let them be sorie, that they haue neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected this dutie so long heretofore, &amp; thereby haue charged so many sinnes of their houshold vpon themselues: and now at the last in Gods holy feare, let them begin to put this in practise,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:210353:93"/> least they doe further prouoke the most patient Lord, to their endles destruction. And, though it be a thing so rare in the world, as it is, &amp; men altogether so vnacqainted with it, as they be, nay, so loathsome &amp; tedious to flesh and blood, that they are afraid once to begin with it: yet let the bare commandment of God preuaile more with vs to take in hand, and to continue in it, then all that can be said or thought against it should weigh with vs, either to keepe vs from it at the first, or afterwards cause vs to giue it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. And, that all men might do it so much the <note place="margin">The want of this care in household, is the cause of much wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</note> rather, let them be assured that the want of this especially, is the cause of so many wicked and rebellious children, vntrustie and disobedient seruants, nay, vnfaithful and vnkind wiues euery where: euen for that their husbands, their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and their masters, do not call vpon them to serue God, and see them sanctifie the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. It is a common and iust complaint in all places, in the mouth of euery man, that seruants and children will not be ruled, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell where to finde a good seruant, they know not whom to trust, but they see not the greatest cause of it to be in themselues, and so go not about to remedy it. For whiles they labor not to make their children the sons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God by adoption, and to bring their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants within the houshold of God, that they might be his seruants by grace, and to make their wiues the chaste spouses of Iesus Christ,

How carefullie hee prouideth by sundrie and many straight commandements for the Maide-seruant that is betrothed. First, that shee shall not goe out of her seruice, as the Men-seruants doe.

For if they, after that they haue setled themselues, and haue satisfied their appetites, shall then resort vnto God by prayer, desiring him that they may obtaine the thing that they most desire: it appeareth that they would make him the Minister of their voluptuous desires and pleasures; and so doing, their vowes and prayers become most manifest blasphemie.</p>

That common-wealth may in some sort be said to be happie, where they haue no vse of these words: <hi>Mine, and thine:</hi> but in marriage especially they ought not to be heard. If the wife haue brought most, goods in marriage, the marriage once consummate and made, her part is gone, and they are gone, and they are made common: as also are the debts, whether hers, or her husbands. And therefore can neither of them say: this is mine, but this is ours. When a woman hath brought great goods, yet may shee not say, I will doe with mine owne what I list: for she her selfe, is not her owne, but her husbands.</p>
                  <p>The husband, as the head and chiefe guide of the familie, must haue the custodie and chiefe gouernment of the goods in the house: yet may he discharge himselfe of the whole, or of part, as himselfe shall thinke meet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient.</p>

                  <p>The particular duties of the husband toward the wife, are: first, to protect her, to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and care ouer her, &amp;c. Ruth. 3. 9. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that hee vnfaynedly loue her, out of which fountaine springeth this dutie, that hee must beare with her infirmities, and not by and by, to enter into bitternesse and wrath: Colos. 3. 16.

                  <p>First, that they neuer say nor doe any thing, that may iustly offend their wiues; as some there be, who being prodigall, great spenders, or idle and slacke in their businesse▪ doe cause their wiues and children to languish in pouertie: others, who haunting Tauernes, Ale-houses, and Gaming, doe consume and waste that which should maintaine their famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: others, who comming home drunke, doe beat and vexe their wiues, and at it were, driue them into despaire: others, who by vile and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terspeeches, by threatnings, and other vnchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian actions, vnworthy a husband, do prouoke their wiues, and so stirre vp such strife and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, as doe conuert the comfort of marriage into an hell.

                  <p>Secondly, that albeit the wife should mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster iust cause of griefe and displeasure, yet that the husband should not thereof take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion against his wiues infirmities, or enter into bitternesse, tauntes, or disquietnesse: but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetely, and patiently beare with her, that so they may quietly, and louingly liue toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

And in as much as prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is an excellent seruice, that God requireth of vs, and the readie meanes to purchase his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, let the husband discreetly beare with his wife, least otherwise through their strife and contention, their praiers (as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith) beletted and interrupted.

                  <p>He must also take heed, that he himselfe be not tainted with the same vice, which hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth in his wife, least shee stop his mouth with the reproach of the same fault: but rather by giuing her example by the contrarie vertue, let her be induced and led to follow him. In reprouing the wife, the husband must alwaies vse such discretion that shee be not brought into contempt: and therefore it should neuer be done in the presence of moe then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. For as it is meere folly for a husband to praise and commend his wife in companie: so is it as dangerous to checke and reproue her before witnesse. For indeede thereof it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that women, not being able to beare that disgrace, will reply, and so prouoke strife, and dissention in open presence, which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to great reproach and offence. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the husband must not flatter his wife, so hee must not reproue her before strangers. A wise husband, and one that seeketh to liue in quiet with his wife, must obserue these three rules: Often to admonish▪ Seldome to reproue: And neuer to smite her.</p>
                  <p>Let the husband also remember, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of his wife, must be either taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, or borne withall. So that he that can take them quite away, maketh his wife farre more commodious and fit for his purpose: and hee

                  <p>The husband is also to vnderstand, that as God created the woman, not the head, and so equall in authoritie with her husband: so also he created her not of <hi>Adams</hi> foote, that shee should be troden downe and despised; but hee tooke her out of the rib, that she might walk<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

And the particular duties of the wife to the husband, are principally these:</p>

                     <item>First, that she be a helper vnto him.</item>

                  <p>These speciall duties are partly touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and partly afterwards.</p>
                  <p>As loue matrimoniall is greatly alowed of God, and much commended of all good men, as an ordinate, holy, and godly loue: so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tratiwise hatred, dissention, strife, debate, vnqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnesse and frowardnes in marriage, highly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaseth God, and much grieueth all good and godly men.</p>

Surely, if a husband (as nature, reason, and the holy Scripture doe witnesse) be the head ouer his wife, and God their father: there ought, to be betweene them such societie and fellowship, yea, and greater then is betweene the father and his sonne, and not such as is betweene the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and the seruant. And amongst many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that may be vsed to perswade the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife to liue together louingly, quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and christianly, this is not the least: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that neither of them is certaine how long they shall liue together, and then the parte that ouerliueth &amp; purposeth to marrie againe, hauing beene churlish, froward, &amp;c. With his former wife; or shee with her first husband, their so hard dealing one with the other before being knowne, will (no doubt be an occasion) that they shall not speed and match so well as otherwise they might, if they had behaued themselues peaceably, and dutifully in their first marriage.</p>

So that this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie and gouernment ought to be in a wife: namely, that she should seldome speake, but to her husband, or by her husband. And as the voice of him that soundeth a trumpet is not so lowd, as the sound that it yeeldeth: so is the wisdome and word of a woman of greater vertue and efficacie, when al that she knoweth, and can doe, is, as if it were said and done by her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. The obedience that the wife oweth to her husband, dependeth vpon this subiection of her will and wisedome vnto him. As 1. Pet. 3. 6. Ephesians 5. 33. Ester. 1. 12. So that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men may not prouoke their husbands by diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, in matters that may be performed without offence to God: neither presume ouer them either in kindred or wealth, or obstinatly <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

If the obedience importeth any difficultie, shee may for her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse gently propound the same: yet vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to obey (in case the husband should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in his intent) so long as the discommoditie importeth no wickednesse. For it is better to <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:210353:187"/> by resistance. And indeede it is naturall in the members to obey the conduct and gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the head. Yet must not this obedience so far extend, as that the husband should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any thing contrarie to her honour, credit, and saluation, but as it is comely in the Lord: Col. 3. 18. Ephes. 5. 22. Therefore, as it were a monstrous matter, and the means to ouerthrow the person, that the body should in refusing all subiection and obedience to the head take vpon it to guide it selfe, and to command the head: so were it for the wife to rebell against the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
                  <p>Let her then beware of disordering and peruerting the course which God in his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath established: and with all let her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that going about it, shee riseth not so much against her husband, as against GOD: and that it is her good and honor to obey God, in her subiection &amp; obedience to her husband. If in the practise of this dutie she find any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie or trouble through the inconsiderate course of her husband, or otherwise; let her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the same proceedeth not of the order established by the Lord, but through some sin afterward crept in, which hath mixed gall among the honie of the subiection and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience that the woman should haue enioyed in that estate, wherein, together with <hi>Adaw,</hi> she was created after the image of God. And so let her humble her selfe in the sight of God,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:210353:187"/> and be well assured that her subiection and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is acceptable vnto him: and that the more that the image of God is restored in her, and her husband, through the generation of the holy Ghost, the lesse difficultie shee shall finde in that subiection and obedience, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in their marriage haue in deed tried, to their great contentment and consolation.</p>

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:210353:191"/> so against the will of God. Besides, it is hurtfull both for the childes bodie, and also for his wi<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> and lastly, it is hurtfull to the mother her selfe, and it is an occasion that she falleth into much sicknesse thereby.</p>
                  <p>First, Nature giueth milke to the woman for none other end, but that shee should bestow it vpon her childe. We see by experience, that cucry beast, and euery fowle is nourished and bred of the same that did beare it: onely some women loue to be mothers, but not nurses. As therefore euery tree doth cherish and nourish that which it bringeth forth: euen so also it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth naturall mothers to nourish their children with their owne milke. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 10.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the examples of the Scriptures are many that prooue this. As <hi>Sarah,</hi> who nursed <hi>Isaac,</hi> though shee were a Princesse, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore able enough to haue had others to have <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 22 7.</note> taken that paines. Though shee was a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull woman, and of great yeares, yet shee her selfe nursed and gaue sucke to her sonne. Also <hi>Anna.</hi> vnto whom the holy Ghost hath <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 23.</note> left it recorded as a commendation, that shee nursed her owne sonne <hi>Samuel.</hi> So when God chose a nurse for <hi>Moses,</hi> hee led the Hand-maide of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 1. <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. 9. <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Luke.</hi> 2. 7. 12.</note> as though GOD would haue none to nurse him but his mother. Likewise, when the Sonne of God was borne, his father thought none sit to be his nurse, but the Virgin his
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:210353:191"/> mother. It is a commendation of a good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 10.</note> and set down in the first place as a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall good worke in a widow that is well repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, if she haue nursed her children. And therefore such as refuse thus to doe, may well and fitly be called nice and vnnaturall mothers: yea, in so doing they make themselues but half-mothers, and so breake the holy bond of nature, in locking vp their breasts from their children, and deliuering them forth like the Cuckoo, to be hatched in the Sparrowes nest.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the childrens bodies be commonly so affected, as the milke is which they receiue. Now, if the Nurse be of an euill complexion; a she is affected in her bodie, or in her minde, or hath some hidden disease, the childe sucking of her breast must needes take part with her. And if that be true which the learned doe say, that the temperature of the mind followes the constitution of the bodie, needs must it be, that if the nurse be of a naughtie nature, the childe must take thereafter. Yet if it be so that the nurse be of a good complexion, and of an honest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour: (whereas contrariwise, Maidens that haue made a scape, are commonly called to be Nurses) yet can it not be, but that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers milke should be much more naturall for the child, then the milke of a stranger. As by experience, let a man be long accustomed to one kinde of drinke, if the same man change his ayre, and his drinke, he is like to mislike it,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:210353:192"/> as the egges of a Henne are altered vnder a Hawke. Neuer thelesse, such women as be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed with infirmities, diseases, want of milke, or other iust and lawfull causes, are to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensed withall. But, whose breasts haue this perpetuall drought? Forsooth, it is like the gowte, no beggers may haue it, but Citizens or gentlewomen. In the 9. of Hosea, verse 14. drie breasts are named for a curse. What a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable hap haue Gentlewomen to light vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this curse, more then other? Sure, if their breasts be drie, as they say they are, they should fast and pray together, that this curse might be remoued from them.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, that it is hurtfull to the mothers themselues both Phisitians can tell, and some women full oft haue felt: when they haue been troubled with sore beasts, besides other disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, that happen to them through plentie of milke.</p>
                  <p>The wife is further to remember, that God hath giuen her two breasts; not that she should employ &amp; vse them for a shew, or of ostentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but in the seruice of God, and to be a help to her husband, in suckling the child common to them both. Experience, teacheth that God conuerteth the mothers blood into the milke, wherewith the child is nursed in her wombe. He bringeth it into the breasts furnished with nipples conuenient to minister the warme milke vnto the child: whom hee indueth with
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:210353:192"/> industrie, to draw out the milke for his owne sustenance. The woman therefore that can suckle her child and doth it not, but refuseth this office and dutie of a mother, declareth her selfe to be very vnthankefull to God, and (as it were) for saketh &amp; contemneth the fruit of her wombe. And therefore the bruit beasts lying vpon the ground, and granting not one nipple or two, but sixe or seuen to their young ones, shall rise in iudgement against these dainetie halfe-mothers, who for feare of wrinckling of their faces, or to auoid some small labour, doe refuse this so necessarie a dutie of a mother due to her children. The properties due to a marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wife, are, that shee haue grauitie when shee walketh abroad: wisedome to gouerne her house: patience to suffer her husband: loue, to breed and bring vp her children: courtesie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards hee neighbours: diligence, to lay vp, and to saue such goods as are within her charge: that she be a friend of honest company, and a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enemie of wanton and light toyes. So then, the principall dutie of the wife, is, first to be subiect to her husband, Ephes. 5. 22. Col. 3. 18. 1. Pet. 3. 1. 2. To be chast and shamefast, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest and silent, godly and discreet. 3. To keepe her selfe at home for the good gouernement of her familie, and not to stray abroad without iust cause.</p>
                  <p>Here it is not to be pretermitted, but wee must say somewhat touching men and women <note place="margin">Stepfathers Stepmothers their duties.</note>
                     <pb n="238" facs="tcp:210353:193"/> that be twise married, and so become Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, and Step-mothers. Such husbands and wiues as marrie againe after the death of their <note place="margin">The Husband must so praise his first Wife, and she her first Husband, as it be not done to the offence or reproch of either to the other. <hi>Iealousie,</hi> which is the suspecting of adulterie in the married par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ought wisely &amp; care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed on both parties, without appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant matter.</note> first wiues, or first husbands, are carefully to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that they do not displease their wiues, or their husbands which they now haue, by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermuch rehearsing of their first wife, or first husband. For the course and condition of the world is such, that husbands and wiues doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count &amp; reckon things past better then things that be present. And the reason is, because no commoditie or selicitie is so great, but it hath some griefe and displeasure, and also some bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse mingled with it: which so long as it is present grieueth vs sore, but when it is once gone, it leaueth no great feeling of it selse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it: and for that cause we seeme to be lesse troubled with sorrowes &amp; discommodities past, then with those that are present. Also age stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth &amp; commeth on apace, which causeth both men and women to be the lesse able to sustain and indure troubles and griefes then, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Therefore such men and women as be twise married, and be wise and religious, ought not to esteeme their wife, or husband which is dead, better then her or him which they enioy now aliue: remembring the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe, That we must liue by the quicke, and not by the dead: and that we must make much of that we now haue. Let the name of Step-father and Step-mother, admonish and put them in
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:210353:193"/> minde of their dutie towards the children of the one and the other. For Step-father &amp; Step-mother, <note place="margin">The verie name of Step-father &amp; Step-mother, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth them their dutie.</note> doth signifie a sted-father and a sted-mother, that is, one father, or one mother di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and another succeedeth and commeth in their stead &amp; roome. Therfore to the end that both their loues may be setled towards the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the one &amp; the other, they must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that they are stead-father and stead-mother, that is, in stead of their owne father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and therefore they ought to loue them, to tender them, and to cherish them, as their owne father or mother did. You must not look vpon them like <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> who told his people, that hee would be worse vnto them then his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor: <note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 12. 13. 10. 21.</note> for then the children will dislike of you, and turne from you, as his subiects did from him: but ye must come to them, as <hi>Dauid</hi> came to the people after <hi>Sauls</hi> death, who said, <note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 7.</note>
                     <hi>Though your master Saul be dead, yet I will raigne ouer you:</hi> so ye must say to them, though your father be dead, or though your mother be dead, yet I will be a father, or I will be a mother vnto you: so the children will loue you, as much as they did their dead father, or dead mother. For that man that is led with discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, reason, and consideration, will reckon himselfe and his wife all one: and likewise, shee will account her selfe and her husband as one. And therefore they ought to account both the children of the one, and of the other, as
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:210353:194"/> common to them both. For if friendship make all things common among friends, insomuch, that many haue loued &amp; fauoured their friends children as their owne, how much more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually and perfectly ought marriage to cause the same, which is the highest degree, not only of friendship, but also of all blood and kindred. But Step-mothers doe more often offend, and faile in this dutie, then men, by reason that their affections be stronger then mens, and many times ouer-rule them: and therefore they are earnestly to be admonished and warned, that they shew to those motherlesse children no Step-mothers friendship, but a right motherly kindnes. Let the Step-mother aduisedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that God hath ordained and appointed her (in stead of their owne mother) to be to them a right true mother, and not onely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them as children but as orphane children, and that he requireth her to loue them, and to doe them good, as to her owne. What a griefe would it be to her hart, if she should know now that her owne children whom shee hath borne in her owne bodie should (after her death) haue a stepmother that would be rigorous, churlish▪ and vnkinde vnto them? doubtlesse those chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens mother, that dead is, had vpon her death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed no lesse care for her children. Let her ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alwaies haue in minde this saying of our Sauiour Christ: <hi>As you measure vnto others, so it shall be measured to you againe,</hi> that is, as the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:210353:194"/> step-mother doth intreate the children of her predecessor, so another wife may come after her, and intreat her children. For he that tooke away the first mother, and sent her, can take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the second mother, and send a third, which will not be like a stead-mother to hers, vnlesse she be like a stead-mother to these. Verely, a good woman will be vnto her husbands chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that which she may heare them call her so often, that is, Mother. For what Christian wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is so farre from all humanitie and naturall affection, that will not be moued and mittiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with is word Mother, of whom soeuer it be spoken? and chiefly of children which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not flatter, but speake euen so from their heart, as they would to their owne mother, of whom they were borne. How sweet is the name of friendship? how many iniuries, hatreds and displeasures doth it hide and put away? Then how much more effectuall ought the sweet name of mother to be, which is full of incredible loue? Therefore euerie religious and louing wife will be mollified and moued in her heart and minde, when she shall heare her selfe named mother, by any of her husbands chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                  <p>Otherwise, she shal shew her selfe to be more vnnaturall and vnkinde, then the wilde sauage beast: for there is no beast so outragious and cruell but if any other yong beast of her owne kind fawne vpon her, she will by and by shew
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:210353:195"/> kindnes and mildnes vnto it. And shall not her husbands children make her kinde and louing vnto them, when they call and speake vnto her, by the louing and sweet name of mother?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third and last point that appertaineth to the duety of wiues, is, that they do not weare <note place="margin">As Wiues ought to goe comely, clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely in their apparrell, so they must in any wise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of pride, riot, or excesse therein.</note> gorgeous and sumptuous apparrell, or broide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red haire trimmed with gold: but that after the example of holy women which trusted in God, they be sober in outward apparrell, and garnished and decked inwardly with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of their minds: as with gentlenesse, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, quietnes, and chastitie, which indeede are most precious things in the sight of God. This point is plainely spoken of by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle to <hi>Timothie,</hi> chap. 2. vers. 9. 10. in which place he so flatly condemneth both the excesse and pride of apparell, as also the pompe, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riositie, and wantonnesse which women vse in trimming their heads, by plaiting, crisping, broi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, curling, and curiously laying out, that no man can say more against it, in so few wordes, then he hath spoken, to the vtter dislike thereof.

Vnto the bodie <note place="margin">Instructing, correcting, and prayer, make good children, and happie Parents. 1. <hi>King.</hi> 2. 2. 5. <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 30.</note> they owe nourishment, bringing vp, apparrell, and sometime correction, that they may keepe children in awe.

By the one, they shall keepe a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence before God. By the other, they shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a good report among men. For these are the two principall points which parents ought to be most carefull to plant in this life in their children, both which the Apostle comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in one verse, where he saith. Ephes. 6. 4. <hi>Yee fathers prouoke not your children to wrath,<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

To haue godly children (no doubt) is the greatest Treasure that may be. For in the children doe the parents liue (in a manner) euen after death. And if they be wel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, catechised, and vertuously brought vp, God is honoured by them, the common wealth is aduanced, yea, their parents, and all other fare the better for them. They are their
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:210353:198"/> parents to comfort, next vnto God, their ioy, staffe, and vpholding of their age: and therfore parents ought to begin betimes to plant ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in their childrens breasts: for late sowing bringeth a late or neuer apt Haruest. Young branches will bow as a man will haue them, but old trees will sooner breake then bow. And therefore as arrowes are an excellent weapon of defence, to a strong &amp; a mightie man that can shoot them with courage: euen so children god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought vp, are a speciall protection and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to their parents.

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:210353:199"/> they offend against their owne credit and estimation. For Gods will is, that Parents should (after a sort) be in his stead, so farre forth <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 26. 27.</note> as pertaineth to outward discipline. But such make small account of this dignitie, who neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect their dutie in this behalfe. Parents are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to vnderstand, that it is their dutie to have diligent care to see their children taught to pray to God, and to rehearse the Apostles Creede, and the ten Commandements. For as by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise their hearts and mindes shall the rather be inclined to godlinesse and reuerence toward God, so as they increase in age, they shall euery day better then other comprehend that which they learne, to their owne comfort, instruction, and saluation. Also, as the tongue is called the glory of man, because that, besides all other reasons, by his speech he is discerned from the bruite beasts: so it is meete, that so soone as the childe can begin to speake, his tongue should be employed to glorifie God, by calling vpon him, and by learning some short Catechisme, containing the principles and grounds of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian religion: as also in repeating the will of God in such sort, as he will that we should serue and honour him.</p>
                  <p>If parents do note or perceiue any vice in their little ones, as swearing, lying, choller, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, filching, couetousnes, contempt of parents, readinesse to strife, and other like corruptions: it is their dutie, diligently &amp; in time to reproue
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:210353:199"/> and correct them; as men vse to plucke vp weeds while they be yet young, least growing vp among the good seeds, they should hinder their growth, &amp; choke them vp. By experience we can see that mothers in swadling their little ones, doe lay their limmes right, each in his place: likewise, if a child be giuen to be left handed, they chide him, yea, sometimes they binde it vp, or otherwise restraine the vse of it, that hee may be accustomed to vse his right hand. Also, if the child haue some string vnder his tongue, they cut it, lest it should hinder his speech: much more then ought they to beware, that through their negligence the vices of the soule doe not increase. For it is the dutie of the parents, euen in the infancie, to begin to shape and frame the soule vnto vertue.</p>
                  <p>It is also the dutie of parents to prouide that their children may learne at the least to write and read: for it may be vnto them a great help in the course of this life, and a treasure of much greater account then mony. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the negligence of many is sharpely to be reproued. Besides that, the performance of this dutie doth greatly binde their children vnto them. Neuerthelesse, the principall end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of should not haue respect to such commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, as the children may reape therby towards the vse of this present life: but rather that they may read the word of God to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and instruction to saluation. Also it
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:210353:200"/> were their parts to vse them daily to read some Chapters of the holy scriptures, thereby to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline and winne their affections to the word of God, to inure and acquaint them in the phrase of the holy Ghost, by little and little to learne the heauenly doctrine, to note the examples of Gods vengeance powred vpon the wicked and disobedient: and of his blessings vnto those that walke in his feare. Therfore if parents do looke that their children should obey them, then let them ioyne &amp; accustome them to Gods word, which will redound much to their parents pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. If they cause their children to heare &amp; read the holy Scriptures, therein they may learne, <hi>Honour thy father and thy mother:</hi> but if pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents doe otherwise, then they traine them vp in the scriptures of diuels, whereout their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren will learne most wicked things: but it is not so when they are instructed in the holie Scriptures. Parents therefore are diligently to apply themselues to this which God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and so often and earnestly commendeth vnto them: namely, to instruct their children in the knowledge and feare of God, and in the faith of Iesus Christ: Deut. 6. 6. 7. and 32. 46. Ephes. 6. 4. So also to teach them those things which they are to vse in their age. It is then great folly to linger children in the learning of vaine, trifling, and vnprofitable things, which as they grow in yeares they will contemne and forget. Parents can be carefull enough to bring
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:210353:200"/> vp their children in some course, trade or other estate, wherein to get their liuings when they come to be men: and verely such fathers as doe neglect that, are vnworthie to haue children. But as the soule is more precious then the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, so is the dutie of parents, in youth to traine vp their children in the practise of those things, wherewith in age, euen in this life, they may glorifie God, and be heires of the Lord. If pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents want knowledge, or be vnwilling to take leisure to teach them; yet let them doe as much for their childrens soules, and the life to come, as for their bodies, and this present life. Parents that either cannot write and read, or will not, or haue not time to teach their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, will yet send them to schoole: and such as would haue them learne some Art or Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or traffique, if themselues professe not the same, wherein they like to employ their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they will yet put them to dwel with those that doe professe the same, to the end they may learne. How therefore can parents excuse themselues, when their children remaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taught in those things that concerne the glorie of God, and life euerlasting? But howsoeuer i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> be, if they be neither able of themselues nor do prouide to haue them taught by others, they shall be inexcusable in the sight of God: and the ignorance of the children, ingendring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God, loue of the world, and neglect of heauenly felicitie, will crie out for euerlasting
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:210353:201"/> vengeance against their parents: so that if they account not their childrem as beastes without soule, or if they loue them with the due loue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to parents, let them declare their loue especially to the soule: the christian instruction whereof surmounteth all worldly treasure.</p>
                  <p>Some say, it would be a great comfort for them in heauen to know their neere kindred, and consequently their children: and this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of naturall affection. But might it not be a greater discomfort for them, euen in their life time, to see them go to hell for want of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? Some charge their children to be dull witted, and hard to be bowed, or brought to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny goodnesse or vertue: Albeit naturall inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be a great help or profiting, yet exercise and custome to do well, is a mightie meanes to bend and shape them that way: yea, euen such, that by experience we finde this old prouerbe true: <hi>Ʋse ouercommeth nature:</hi> as the wheele▪wright doth by strength bow his timber, and letting it lie long in that bent, it bideth crooked Barren ground well tilled, soyled, and sow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

As contrariwise,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:210353:201"/> the wit most inclined by nature to vertue, may by bad instruction and the conuersation of the wicked be peruerted, and grow vicious.</p>
                  <p>Parents therefore are herein to respect two points: first, to begin to frame and bend their children in their tender youth to vertue, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that a seale entereth deepest into softest Waxe. They must be carefull that they do not speake or tell any foolish tales, baudie rimes▪ or vngodly speeches before their children, least they infect their tender wits with folly and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonishment. Experience sheweth that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren will sooner learne any language by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation then elder folkes. Also that the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the twig is, the sooner it is bent or made straight.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is the parents dutie to restraine their children from haunting and conuersing with such as be vicious, peruerse, and wicked. And vndoubtedly we see that they doe soone learne villanous and vnseemely speeches, and malicious lewde actions, with their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and as the old Prouerbe saith, halting with the lame, they shall learne to halt. A childe that naturally speaketh wel, by conuersing with such as corrupt their speech, shall degenerate and speake as badly. Tye a young twig that is crooked with a straight one that is stronger then it, and in growing it will become straight, and so continue when it is vndone. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise, a straight one tyed to that which is
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:210353:202"/> crooked, and stronger then it selfe, will grow and continue crooked,</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, parents when they meane to put forth their children to any trade or occupation, or to learning, then they ought carefully to see and enquire whether such as they thinke to place them withall, be religious and vertuous, and endued with the feare of God.</p>
                  <p>In the admittance of a seruant, the feare of some temporall or carnall inconuenience, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth men to enquire of his, or her truth, hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, or other qualities. Therefore if Parents shall commit their childe to the ordering and instruction of a Master, before they make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie of his honestie and christian conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they plainely shew that they haue lesse care of the corrupting or infecting of their childe with vice, then of some small inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience that might happen by an vnhonest and vnthriftie seruant.</p>
                  <p>When men buy an earthen pot they sound vpon it, to see whether it be broken, least they should be deceiued in a small peece of monie, yet doe they not sound whether the Master to whom they commit their childe be vicious, or vertuous: albeit by putting and placing him with one that is vicious and irreligious, they put him in daunger of losse, both of bodie and soule.</p>
                  <p>Some doe respect their friendship with some Masters, rather then their vertue, and so doe
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:210353:202"/> commit to them their children, least they should be angrie for putting them to another.</p>
                  <p>These men doe resemble and be like him, who being dangerously sicke, vseth the aduise of an ignorant Physition, that is his kinsman or familiar friend, for feare he should take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, if he should call another, albeit, without comparison, more learned and skilfull.</p>
                  <p>If thou shouldest haue any waightie matter in law, wouldest thou rather commit thy cause to an ignorant and negligent atturney, because he is thy friend, then to him that were both di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>Others commit their children, either to him, that will take them at the easiest rate, or by whom they may grow into greatest aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the world, but neuer respect the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of their childe, so they may either spare, or get worldly goods. Let them also be carefull to restraine their children from vice, &amp; to inure &amp; accustome them tovertue: and indeed the fathers that instruct, or cause their children to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, do far excell such, as onely doe beget them: for of these they receiue life only, of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good &amp; vertuous life. Yet parents ought not
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:210353:203"/> so much to relie and rest vpon the diligence of their childrens masters, as neuer to care to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand how they profit and goe forward in learning and vertue? for the regard of such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence would make the masters more careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to discharge their duties.

For where a vertuous and godly childhood goeth before, there a godly and vertuous age followeth after. Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, when the parents are not carefull to teach their children to know God, and to know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: when they do not breed them vp in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, nor reproue them when they doe amisse,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:210353:203"/> they then become corrupt in their vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and abhominable in their doings: igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and void of all knowledge and grace, and of reuerence or feeling of nature.</p>
                  <p>If Parents be desirous to haue their children vertuous, and honest indeed (as in conscience they ought) then they must be diligent and <note place="margin">wont to take their shape</note> carefull to practise godlinesse and honestie themselues.

What account can those Parents giue vnto GOD, who by their euill example, haue drawne into Hell their children, whom he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to their charge to be guided into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen? Albeit such parents pitie not themselues, yet at least let them take pitie of their children, and not carrie them with them into euerlasting destruction.

Albeit children, in respect and reuerence to their parents, dare not reply and say, themselues doe these things, for the

                  <p>If parents therfore desire that their instruction may be effectuall, and yeeld fruit, let them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the same in holy life, and vertuous conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation: let them so order &amp; gouerne themselues, that their children seeing the same as it were in a glasse, may be restrained from dishonest speech and wicked deeds: let them doe as guides, that shew the right way ouer foords and riuers, by going before those whom they leade: that their children following the steps and examples of their parents, may conforme themselues to their vertues, and so with them, and by them, be led to saluation, and life euerlasting.</p>

And further, they must giue an entercourse of speech vnto others: and so suffer others to speake by them; for there is a time to keepe silence, and so to heare others speaking, for he that will haue all the talke, passeth the bounds of good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, Parents ought to teach their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, how to frame their gestures to a reuerent <note place="margin">Good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in gesture.</note> and dutifull behauiour towards others: which consisteth in these points.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first is to meete those that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming towards them. And of this they haue an example in holy <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 18. 2. where it is said: <hi>And he lifted vp his eyes and looked, and loe, three men stood by him, and when he saw them, he ranne to meete them from the tent doore.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, another example they may haue in King <hi>Salomon,</hi> sitting vpon his regall throne: 1. King. 2. 19. <hi>Bathsheba therefore went to King</hi> Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>to speake vnto him for</hi> Adoniah, <hi>and the King rose to meete her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The second is, to rise vp to elders and betters when they passe by them. And this is taught Leuit. 19. 23. <hi>Thou shalt rise vp before the hoare head, and honour the person of the olde man, and dread thy God: I am the Lord.</hi> But heere wee must warne you of a great abuse,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:210353:212"/> which for the most part is committed in all Churches, and which tendeth to the high dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of God: which is this, that neither you your selues, neither your children, nor seruants, doe know the time of your duties, but you will then rise vp to men, when both you and they should kneele downe to God: as if one that is more honourable among you, shall come into the Church, while you are vpon your knees in prayer vnto God, presently you start vp, and leaue God, to reuerence men. Is this religion? is this deuotion becomming Gods house? is not this all one, as if a man should say, stay GOD heere comes in my father, my master, my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull neighbour, and my good friend, to whom I am much beholden, I must doe my dutie vnto him, I must rise vp till hee be past, and then I will come to thee againe? What is this but to preferre men before GOD? this doing plainely sheweth, that such are louers of men, more then God: and that such as take this dutie and reuerence vpon them, are rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Gods honour, and they shall answere him for it.</p>
                  <p>Is there no time to shew our dutie towards men; but euen then when wee are about Gods seruice? Why, know thou, when man <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>andeth before God, how honourable so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he be, hee is but dung and filth, and not to be regarded in comparison of him. And let Parents learne this wisedome, that while
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:210353:213"/> they are taught their duties towards men, it is not to rob God of his worship: but there is an appoynted time to euery dutie and purpose: as <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> in his third Chapter well admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth: <hi>To all things there is an appointed time, and a time to euery purpose vnder the heauen.</hi> It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded <note place="margin">

                     <hi>haue I to doe with thee?</hi> which examples will teach vs, that when we are about Gods seruice, all other duties must sleepe and be laid a part.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third dutie of good manners to be obserued in their gesture, is to stand while their betters are sitting in place: example of this wee haue in holy <hi>Abraham,</hi> of his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainning of the two strangers, as it is written. Gen. 18. 8. <hi>And he tooke butter and milke, and the Calfe which hee had prepared, and set before them and stood by himselfe vnder the tree, and they did eate.</hi> Well may <hi>Abraham</hi> be called the father
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:210353:213"/> of the faithfull, for giuing his children so good example.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Their fourth dutie, is to bend the knee, in token of humilitie and subiection: example of this, 1. King. 2. 19.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The fift thing is, that they giue the chiefe place to their betters, and to offer the same to others in courtesie. 1. King. 2. 19. Luke. 14. 8. 9. 10. Pro. 15. 33. and 16. 18.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Their last dutie is, to vncouer their head. And though wee finde no example for this in holy scripture, as being not vsed in those for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times: yet seeing the thing is eiuill and comely, and one of the speciall courtesies of our daies, we will confirme it also with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of Gods word: Phil. 4. 8. <hi>Whatsoeuer things are honest, whatsoeuer things are of good report, those things do.</hi> And again. 1, Cor. 14. 40. <hi>Let all things be done decently, and according to <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>der.</hi> Now this kind of ciuilitie, is both decent and according to order, as also honest, and of good report: and therefore warranted and commended by Gods word, and so worthy to be followed.</p>
                  <p>Therefore if our children be not thus <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>The wise man sheweth parents, when is the best time to sow the seede of vertue in their children, that it may bring forth the fruit of life, and make them alway readie to die: saying, Eccle. 12. 1. <hi>Remember now</hi> (saith he) <hi>thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>

And so all their life shall runne in a line, the middle like the beginning, and the end like the middle: as the Sunne setteth against the place where it rose.</p>
                  <p>One of the principallest duties that belong to parents towards their children, is, that they <note place="margin">Marriage with Papists, &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 23. <hi>Verse</hi> 24.</note> be very warie and carefull, that their sonnes and daughters doe not match in marriage with such as are vngodly, wicked, and voyd of true

<pb n="356" facs="tcp:210353:252"/> which their louing parents haue taken with them, and make some amends for the vncoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teruailable kindnesse that they haue shewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them.</p>
                     <p>But where they bestow themselues in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage without the consent of their parents, there they doe fault, and make a breach of dutie, in all these three respects: that is to say, they ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reuerence, obey, nor shew themselues thankfull vnto them.</p>
                     <p>For Reuerence consisteth in this, that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren carry towards their parents a certaine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and modest shamefastnesse, ioyned with a bashful awfulnesse, &amp; standing in feare of them, the which worketh in them a conceiuing of such an opinion and estimation of them, as that they haue an especiall respect and regard of them, in doing or not doing of things, rather of a care to please them, then of a feare to offend them.</p>
                     <p>Obedience herein sheweth forth it selfe, in that willingly without murmuring or grudging they be willing to be ordered, directed, guided, and ruled by their parents: being ready to doe all lawfull things, which they command them, and to refraine from those things, which they shall forbid them.</p>
                     <p>Thankfuluesse (besides that there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other branches) is alwayes mindfull of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits receiued, and therefore carryeth continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a vigilant and watchfull eye towards the
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:210353:252"/> partie by whom it hath beene pleasured that no discourtisie in any case be offred, or any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion be ministred, whereby hee may conceiue vnkindnesse.</p>
                     <p>And by this familiar description of these three heads (wherein standeth chiefely, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due vnto parents,) wee may clearely see that those children which in wedding tarry not for the consent of their fathers and mothers, doe neither stand in awfull feare of them, as whom they would be loath to offend or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please; nor yet giue ouer themselues in all things to be gouerned and aduised by them, nor haue any regard, that they be not causers to make their friends and parents conceiue hardly and vnkindly of them; when as it is more then manifest, that in matters concerning their dutie towards their parents, no griefe cutteth nearer vnto the heart, then this, when their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren entangle themselues contrary to their minde and liking.</p>
                     <p>And therefore such children as match in this sort, as it were in spight of the teeth of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and mothers, are neither reuerent, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, nor thankful vnto them, and so consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they doe not honour them: whereby they incurre and runne into the curse of God, which without true and vnfained repentance, must needes pull downe vpon the heads of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and their families, the fearefull plagues of God his most heauy and hot indignation

                     <p>Let all dutifull and good nurtured children therefore, in the reuerence and feare of God, consider what honour and obedience they owe vnto their parents, and what power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie hee hath in his word sanctified vnto them ouer their children in the Lord; and in regard hereof, let them yeeld vnto them in this dutie, that their fathers hauing prouided for them such as are not of a wicked life, nor deformed, nor euill fauoured, nor of a contrary religion, they willingly submit themselues vnto their choise; which if for the present, or vpon the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine they cannot yeeld vnto, let them by ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest <note place="margin">Children mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>These precepts and admonitions before said, are as a summary of the duties of children to their parents. And therefore it resteth, that they vnderstanding them, doe pray vnto God to giue them grace to put them in practise to his glory, and their good and saluation.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, let them remember, that God is not more inclined to heare any prayers, then such as parents doe poure forth for their children. As they are therefore to feare their curse, for offending them: so must they by honouring and pleasing them, seeke to be blessed in their prayers, which are blessings ratified vnto them in heauen, as the blessing of <hi>Isaac</hi> to his sonne <hi>Iacob,</hi> doth manifestly declare.

<pb n="376" facs="tcp:210353:262"/> the Law of God did charge the Magistrate that he should not cause aboue fortie stripes to be inflicted vpon any offender, lest hee should seeme despised in his eyes, much lesse then may a master exceede that number to his seruant.</p>
                  <p>For while a childe, or scholler, or seruant doth thinke that he is reproued for loue, or bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with reason, it makes him think of his fault, and is ashamed: but when hee seeth that hee is rebuked with curses, and beaten with staues, as though hee were hated like a dogge, his heart is hardned against the man which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth him, and the fault for the which he is corrected, and after he becommeth desperate, like a horse which turneth vpon the striker: and therefore let masters know, that God euen then chides them, whensoeuer they fight or chide in such rage. For though there be a fault, yet some thing must be dissembled and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked at, and some things must be forgiuen, and some punished with a looke: for he which takes the forfeit of euerie offence, shall neuer be in any rest, but vexe himselfe more then his seruant.</p>
                  <p>But aboue all, we thinke that the charitie and tender affection of masters: &amp; loue of seruants <note place="margin">Masters ought to haue a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der care of their seruants in their sickenesse. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 5. 6. <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 1.</note> to their fellowes in their sicknesse, is especially to be vsed and shewed: at which time the sick are to be seuerally lodged from the whole, and to be cherished and nourished with more choise and daintie meate.</p>

                  <p> For the performance and care of this dutie, the Centurion is commended in the Gospel, which dutie very vnchristianly is neglected of many masters.</p>

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>easts reioyce to see their masters cherish and feed, them, as we may daily see in dogges: how much more may we beleeue that men and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable creatures are much delighted and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted therewith? Whereupon it comes to passe, that good and faithfull seruants, liking and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting their masters, vnderstand them at a becke, and obey them at a winke of the eye, or bent of the brow, not as a water-spaniell, but as the hand is stirred to obey the minde, so prompt and ready is the dutifull seruant to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey his louing and kind master.</p>
                  <p>For as the hand is said to be the instrument of instruments, being it (indeed) that serues to seede, apparell, and keepe cleane the rest of the limmes, and parts of the body, which are also called instruments: so is the seruant said to be an instrument of instruments, because hee keepeth all the instruments of household oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied: not onely to liue, but to liue well, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he differeth from all other instruments. For where they are things without soule, hee is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinely enriched with a soule: &amp; herein he diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from the hand, for that the hand is fastned,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:210353:263"/> and vnited to the bodie, but he is seperate and disioyned from his master: and he is also diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from Artificers: for Artificers are instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of those things which properly they cal workmanship: but the seruant is instrument of the action, which also is distinguished from workmanship. So that the seruant, if you will rightly vnderstand him, is, a liuely and seuerall instrument of action.</p>
                  <p>It is very meete and conuenient, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse or Dame, doe not make her selfe too fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar <note place="margin">The wiues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour with seruants.</note> with her seruants, or household folkes, least they should be too bold to talke, to ieast, or vnreuerently and vnmannerly to behaue themselues towards her, and so modestly and wisely to beare her selfe among her seruants, that they may feare, reuerence, and so stand in awe of her, as the Mistresse and mother of the house.</p>

                  <p>Therefore we read, that <hi>Abraham</hi> would not

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His dutie consisteth in three points:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. First, that seruants and pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices doe from their hearts, cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and willingly, performe the labours and workes, that their masters, mistres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, or dames, shall command them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, that they be faithfull in things committed to them by their masters, mistresses and dames, that so they may keepe their goods.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, that they be carefull to obserue vprightnesse of manners, that the wife, sonnes and daughters, or other fellow seruants, be not corrupted by their bad counsels, or lewd beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour.</p>
                  <p>These points are plainely proued by these <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 5. 6. 7. 8. <hi>Coloss.</hi> 3. 22. 23. 24. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 9. 10. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18. 19 20. 21.</note> places of Scripture quoted in the margine: whereby seruants are straightly charged, reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, and faithfully to obey their bodily ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, mistresses, and dames, in all things which may be done without offence to God. And this
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:210353:264"/> obedience and seruice must be done with feare <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 1. 2. <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 7. 8. 9.</note> and trembling, in singlenesse of heart, as vnto Christ, they being moued with a reuerence to-Godward, as though they serued God himself, and that as well in the absence of their masters, mistresses or dames, as in their presence: not constrainedly, as it were forced or compelled thereto, but heartily and with good will, as they that serue the Lord, and not men: not onely in respect of the earthly reward, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they know, and are assured, that of the Lord they shall receiue the reward of inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, in as much as they serue the Lord Christ. So that hereby all godly seruants, may in few words learne what dutie they owe to their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, mistresses, and dames: namely, to loue them, and to be affectioned towards them, as a dutifull childe is to his father: to be reuerent <note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 5. 13. The propert of a good ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uant.</note> and lowly to them in their wordes and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures: to suffer and forbeare them: to obey with readie and willing minds all their lawfull and reasonable commaundements: to feare them, and to be loth to displease them: to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and trustie to them and theirs: in deedes and promises, to be diligent and seruiceable: to speake cheerefully: to answere discreetly: not ouer boldly to dallie with their Masters wife, daughters, or maidens: to be loyall and dutifull to their masters, mistresses, and dames: as <hi>Iacob</hi> was towards <hi>Laban,</hi> and <hi>Ioseph</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Potiphar.</hi> And they must carefully <note place="margin">

                     <pb n="382" facs="tcp:210353:265"/> indeuour to doe and procure, to the vttermost of their abilitie, that which may be to their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, mistresses, and dames honestie, credit and profit, and that as well when they are absent and out of sight, as when they be present and looke on. This is a qualitie and propertie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to euery good seruant, both men and maides: to wit, that whatsoeuer goods or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries of their masters, mistresses, or dames, they shall haue charge of, as committed to their trust and keeping; they carefully see such things so well and orderly placed, and laid vp, that if there shall be at any time any iust occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to vse any necessarie in their custodie: yea, if it be in the night season, and that without a light, they then not onely can say, in such a place it lyeth, but also, if they be required, they can presently fetch the same.</p>
                  <p>Seruants must take heede that they doe not wittingly and willingly anger or displease their masters, mistresses, or dames, which if they do, then they ought incontinent and forthwith to reconcile themselues vnto them, and to aske them forgiuenesse. They must also forbeare them, and suffer their angrie and hastie words, and in no wise answere againe spightfully or scornefully, neither yet vpon any such occasion run away. For the Angel taught and willed <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> the seruant of <hi>Sarah,</hi> when shee fled from <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 16. 7. 8. 9.</note> her mistresse, that she should returne and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble her selfe vnder the hands of her mistresse.
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:210353:265"/> So did Saint <hi>Paul</hi> make agreement betwixt <hi>Onesimus</hi> a vagabond and theeuish seruant, and sent him againe to his master <hi>Philemon,</hi> from <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Phil.</hi> 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> whom he was fled away, and it is probable that he admonished <hi>Onesimus</hi> to submit himselfe to his master.</p>
                  <p>Seruants and prentices therefore according to the rule of Gods word, must patiently beare, and forbeare their masters, mistresses, and dames and doe whatsoeuer lawfull thing they shall command them, not being against a good conscience. And therefore they must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, how farre forth they are bound to obey <note place="margin">How farre forth seruants ought to obey their masters.</note> their masters, that is, <hi>Ʋsque ad aras:</hi> that is, so far as Christian religion suffereth, and so far forth as they may do it with an vpright conscience: for otherwise, if their maisters shall command them to do any thing that is vnhonest, vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, wicked, vniust, or vngodly then they must in no wise obey it. 1. Sam. 20. 28. &amp;c. and 22. 17. Dan. 3. 18. Act. 4. 19. and 5. 29.</p>
                  <p>The conditions of a good maid-seruant, are, that she be carefull, faithfull, patient, neat, and pleasant: that she be cleanly, quicke, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and of few words; honest in her word, deed, and attire: diligent in a household, and haue skill in washing, baking, brewing, sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and spinning, but chiefly in holding her peace.</p>
                  <p>Seruants must lay apart all euill conditions, pride, vnfaithfulnesse, brawling, murmuring,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:210353:266"/> lying, swearing, and filthie communication, picking; stealing, and tales telling.</p>
                  <p>If seruants would carefully mark and learne, and so diligently practise these three shortles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 9.</note> following: so doing (no doubt) they might both procure and purchase much quietnesse to themselues, and also winne and get the great good will and liking of their masters, mistres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and dames, thereby: First, that they would cheerefully go when they are bidden. Secondly, that they would come willingly and readilie when they be called. And lastly, that they would remember to shut and sparre the doores after them. They neglect and omitting of this last dutie, may happily be thought no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but if such as be house-keepers will care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obserue it, they shall finde, that they su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine both losse and hinderanee by it.</p>

                  <p> Againe, seruants are to be admonished and <note place="margin">Seruants must to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of their power, seeke the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and benefit of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</note> put in minde, that they doe not (as some doe without all conscience) make spoyle and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uock of their masters goods, wittingly, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, neyther yet that they suffer any of those things that they are put in trust with, through their heedlesnesse and retchlesnesse, to be mard and lost: but specially that they doe not make spoyle and waste of such broken meate as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth after their meales, or at other times: which doing is not onely an hinderance to their masters profit, but also a great offence to God, who commandeth that such broken meate as remaineth be gathered vp and saued, that so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothing be lost.
